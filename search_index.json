Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\nUse Cases\n\nAsynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition \nJSON Binding Rules \nScheme Rules  \n\nData Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices  \nSignature  \nEncryption  \n\nGlossary\nThis document provides the glossary for the Open API (Application Programming Interface) for FSP (Financial Service Provider) Interoperability (hereafter cited as \"the API\"). Terms have been compiled from three sources:\n\nITU-T Digital Financial Services Focus Group Glossary (ITU-T),\nFeedback from Technology Service Providers (TSPs) in the PDP work groups (PDP) and\nFeedback from the L1P IST Reference Implementation team (RI).\n\nInformation is shared in accordance with Creative Commons Licensing.\nLogical Data Model\nThis document introduces the four generic transaction patterns that are supported in a logical version of the API. Additionally, all logical services that are part of the API are presented on a high-level.\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\nThis document specifies the logical data model used by the API. Section 2 in the document lists elements used by each service. Section 3 in the document describes the data model in terms of basic elements, simple data types and complex data types.\nUse Cases\nThe purpose of this document is to define a set of use cases that can be implemented using the API. The use cases referenced within this document provide an overview of transaction processing flows and business rules of each transaction step as well as relevant error conditions. The primary purpose of the API is to support the movement of financial transactions between one Financial Services Provider (FSP) and another.\nIt should be noted that the API is only responsible for message exchange between FSPs and a Switch when a cross-FSP transaction is initiated by an End User in one of the FSPs. This can occur in either of two scenarios: \n\nA bilateral scenario in which FSPs communicate with each other\nA Switch based scenario in which all communication goes through a Switch \n\nReconciliation, clearing and settlement after real time transactions is out of scope for the API. Additionally, account lookup is supported by the API, but it relies on the implementation in a local market in which a third party or Switch would provide such services. Therefore, the need for effective on-boarding processes and appropriate scheme rules must be considered when implementing use cases.\nAPI Definition\nThe API Definition document introduces and describes the API. The purpose of the API is to enable interoperable financial transactions between a Payer (a payer of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in one FSP (an entity that provides a digital financial service to an end user) and a Payee (a recipient of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in another FSP. The API does not specify any front-end services between a Payer or Payee and its own FSP; all services defined in the API are between FSPs. FSPs are connected either (a) directly to each other or (b) by a Switch placed between the FSPs to route financial transactions to the correct FSP. \nThe transfer of funds from a Payer to a Payee should be performed in near real-time. As soon as a financial transaction has been agreed to by both parties, it is deemed irrevocable. This means that a completed transaction cannot be reversed in the API. To reverse a transaction, a new negated refund transaction should be created from the Payee of the original transaction.  \nThe API is designed to be sufficiently generic to support both a wide number of use cases and extensibility of those use cases, However, it should contain sufficient detail to enable implementation in an unambiguous fashion.Version 1.0 of the API is designed to be used within a country or region; international remittance that requires foreign exchange is not supported. This version also contains basic support for the Interledger Protocol, which will in future versions of the API be used for supporting foreign exchange and multi-hop financial transactions.\nThis document:\n\nDefines an asynchronous REST binding of the logical API introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nAdds to and builds on the information provided in Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification. The contents of the Specification are listed in Section Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification.\n\nScheme Rules\nThis document defines scheme rules for Open API for FSP Interoperability (hereafter cited as the API) in three categories.\n\nBusiness Scheme Rules:a.    These business rules should be governed by FSPs and an optional regulatory authority implementing the API within a scheme.b.    The regulatory authority or implementing authority should identify valid values for these business scheme rules in their API policy document.   \nAPI implementation Scheme Rules:a.    These API parameters should be agreed on by FSPs and the optional Switch. These parameters should be part of the implementation policy of a scheme.b.    All participants should configure these API parameters as indicated by the API-level scheme rules for the implementation with which they are working.   \nSecurity and Non-Functional Scheme Rules.a.    Security and non-functional scheme rules should be determined and identified in the implementation policy of a scheme.   \n\nJSON Binding Rules\nThe purpose of this document is to express the data model used by the API in the form of JSON Schema binding rules, along with validation rules for the corresponding instances.\nThis document adds to and builds on the information provided in Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification. The contents of the Specification are listed in Section 1.1.\nThe types used in the PDP API fall primarily into three categories:\n\nBasic data types and Formats used\nElement types\nComplex types\n\nThe various types used in API Definition, Data Model and the Open API Specification, as well as the JSON transformation rules to which their instances must adhere, are identified in the following sections.\nPKI Best Practices\nThis document explains Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  best practices to apply in the API deployment. See Chapter 2, PKI Background, for more information about PKI. \nThe API should be implemented in an environment that consists of either:\n\nFinancial Service Providers (FSPs) that communicate with other FSPs (in a bilateral setup) or \nA Switch that acts as an intermediary platform between FSP platforms. There is also an Account Lookup System (ALS) available to identify in which FSP an account holder is located.\n\nFor more information about the environment, see Chapter 3, Network Topology. Chapters 4 and 5 identify management strategies for the CA and for the platform. Communication between platforms is performed using a REST (REpresentational State Transfer)-based HTTP protocol (for more information, see API Definition). Because this protocol does not provide a means for ensuring either integrity or confidentiality between platforms, extra security layers must be added to protect sensitive information from alteration or exposure to unauthorized parties.\nSignature\nThis document details security methods to be implemented for the API to ensure confidentiality of API messages between an API client and the API server.\nIn information security, confidentiality means that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes (Excerpt ISO27000 ). For the API, confidentiality means that some sensitive fields in the payload of an API message cannot be accessed or identified in an unauthorized or undetected manner by the intermediaries involved in the API communication. That is, if some fields of an API message are encrypted by the API client, then only the expected API recipient can decrypt those fields.\nJSON Web Encryption (JWE RFC7516 )must be applied to the API to provide message confidentiality. When an API client sends an HTTP request (such as an API request or callback message) to a counterparty, the API client can determine whether there are sensitive fields in the API message to be protected according to the regulation or local schema. If there is a field to be protected, then the API client uses JWE to encrypt the value of that field. Subsequently, the cipher text of that field will be transmitted to the counterparty.\nTo support encryption for multiple fields of an API message, JWE is extended in this document to adapt to the requirements of the API.\nEncryption\nThis document details the security methods to be implemented for the API to ensure integrity and non-repudiation between the API client and the API server.\nIn information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle. For the API, data integrity means that an API message cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner by parties involved in the API communication.\nIn legal terms, non-repudiation means that a person intends to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also means that one party in a transaction cannot deny having received the transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent the transaction. For the API, non-repudiation means that an API client cannot deny having sent an API message to a counterparty. JSON Web Signature (JWS), as defined in RFC 7515 , must be applied to the API to provide message integrity and non-repudiation for either component fields of an API payload or the full API payload. Whenever an API client sends an API message to a counterparty, the API client should sign the message using its private key. After the counterparty receives the API message, the counterparty must validate the signature with the API client’s public key. Only the HTTP request message of an API message need to be signed, any HTTP response message of the APIs SHALL NOT be signed.   \nNote:\n\nThe corresponding public key should either be shared in advance with the counterparty or retrieved by the counterparty (for example, the local scheme Certificate Authority).\n\nBecause intermediary fees are not supported in the current version of the API, intermediaries involved in API message-transit may not modify the API message payload. Thus, the signature at full payload level is used to protect the integrity of the full payload of an API message from end-to-end. Regardless of how many intermediaries there are in transit, the original payload cannot be modified by the intermediaries. The final recipient of the API message must validate the signature generated by the original API client based on the message payload received.\nNotes:\n\nWhether the signature needs to be validated by the intermediaries in transit is determined by the internal implementation of each intermediary or the local schema.\nIn a future version of the API, intermediary fees may be supported; at that time, signature-at-field-level may also be supported. However, both features are out-of-scope for the current version (1.0) of the API.\n\n"},"documents/Glossary.html":{"url":"documents/Glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nOpen API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface\n1.1 Conventions Used in This Document\n1.2 Document Version Information\n\nIntroduction\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\n\nAPI Glossary\n\n\n1 Preface\nThis section contains information about how to use this document.\n1.1 Conventions Used in This Document\nThe following conventions are used in this document to identify the specified types of information.\n\n\n\nType of Information\nConvention\nExample\n\n\n\n\nElements of the API, such as resources\nBoldface\n/authorization\n\n\nVariables\nItalics within curled brackets\n{ID}\n\n\nGlossary\nItalics on first occurrence; defined in Glossary\nThe purpose of the API is to enable interoperable financial transactions between a Payer (a payer of terms electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in one FSP (an entity that provides a digital financial service to an end user) and a Payee (a recipient of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in another FSP.\n\n\nLibrary documents\nItalics\nUser information should, in general, not be used by API deployments; the security measures detailed in API Signature and API Encryption should be used instead.\n\n\n\n1.2 Document Version Information\n\n\n\nVersion\nDate\nChange Description\n\n\n\n\n1.0\n2018-03-13\nInitial version\n\n\n\n2.

The format of the email should be according to the informational RFC 3696.\n\n\nPERSONAL_ID\nUsed when some kind of personal identifier should be used as reference to a participant. Examples of personal identification can be passport number, birth certificate number, national registration number or similar. The identifier number shall be added in the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type shall be added in the PartySubIdOrType element.\n\n\nBUSINESS\nUsed when a specific Business (for example, an Organization or a Company) should be used as reference to a participant. The Business identifier can be in any format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.\n\n\nDEVICE\nUsed when a specific Device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a specific Business or Organization should be used as reference to a Party. To use a specific device under a specific Business or Organization, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.\n\n\nACCOUNT_ID\nUsed when a bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as reference to a participant. The  ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format, as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.\n\n\nIBAN\nUsed when a bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as reference to a participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric characters and should be entered without any whitespace.\n\n\nALIAS\nUsed when an alias should be used as reference to a participant. The alias should be created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner. Another example of an alias can be username in the FSP system. The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined by the PartyIdentifier.\n\n\n\nTable 97 – Enumeration PartyIdType\n4.5.7 PersonalIdentifierType\nTable 98 contains the allowed values for the enumeration PersonalIdentifierType.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPASSPORT\nUsed when a passport number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nNATIONAL_REGISTRATION\nUsed when a national registration number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nDRIVING_LICENSE\nUsed when a driving license should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nALIEN_REGISTRATION\nUsed when an alien registration number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nNATIONAL_ID_CARD\nUsed when a national ID card number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nEMPLOYER_ID\nUsed when a tax identification number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nTAXI_ID_NUMBER\nUsed when a tax identification number should be used as reference to a Party.\n\n\nSENIOR_CITIZENS_CARD\nUsed when a senior citizens card number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nMARRIAGE_CERTIFICATE\nUsed when a marriage certificate number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nHEALTH_CARD\nUsed when a health card number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nVOTERS_ID\nUsed when a voters identification number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nUNITED_NATIONS\nUsed when an UN (United Nations) number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\nOTHER_ID\nUsed when any other type of identification type number should be used as reference to a Party\n\n\n\nTable 98 – Enumeration PersonalIdentifierType\n4.5.8 TransactionInitiator\nTable 99 contains the allowed values for the enumeration TransactionInitiator.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPAYER\nThe sender of funds is initiating the transaction. The account to send from is either owned by the Payer or is connected to the Payer in some way.\n\n\nPAYEE\nThe recipient of the funds is also initiating the transaction by sending a transaction request. The Payer must approve the transaction, either automatically by a pre-generated OTP, pre-approval of the Payee, or by manually approving in his or her own Device.\n\n\n\nTable 99 – Enumeration TransactionInitiator\n4.5.9 TransactionInitiatorType\nTable 100 contains the allowed values for the enumeration TransactionInitiatorType.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCONSUMER\nConsumer is the initiator of the transaction.\n\n\nAGENT\nAgent is the initiator of the transaction.\n\n\nBUSINESS\nBusiness is the initiator of the transaction.\n\n\nDEVICE\nDevice is the initiator of the transaction.\n\n\n\nTable 100 – Enumeration TransactionInitiatorType\n4.5.10 TransactionRequestState\nTable 101 contains the allowed values for the enumeration TransactionRequestState.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRECEIVED\nPayer FSP has received the transaction from the Payee FSP.\n\n\nPENDING\nPayer FSP has sent the transaction request to the Payer.\n\n\nACCEPTED\nPayer has approved the transaction.\n\n\nREJECTED\nPayer has rejected the transaction.\n\n\n\nTable 101 – Enumeration TransactionRequestState\n4.5.11 TransactionScenario\nTable 102 contains the allowed values for the enumeration TransactionScenario.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDEPOSIT\nUsed for performing a Cash-In (deposit) transaction, where in the normal case electronic funds are transferred from a Business account to a Consumer account, and physical cash is given from the Consumer to the Business User.\n\n\nWITHDRAWAL\nUsed for performing a Cash-Out (withdrawal) transaction, where in the normal case electronic funds are transferred from a Consumer’s account to a Business account, and physical cash is given from the Business User to the Consumer.\n\n\nTRANSFER\nUsed for performing a P2P (Peer to Peer, or Consumer to Consumer) transaction.\n\n\nPAYMENT\nTypically used for performing a transaction from a Consumer to a Merchant/Organization, but could also be for a B2B (Business to Business) payment. The transaction could be online to purchase in an Internet store, in a physical store where both the Consumer and Business User are present, a bill payment, a donation, and so on.\n\n\nREFUND\nUsed for performing a refund of transaction.\n\n\n\nTable 102 – Enumeration TransactionScenario\n4.5.12 TransactionState\nTable 103 contains the allowed values for the enumeration TransactionState.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRECEIVED\nPayee FSP has received the transaction from the Payer FSP.\n\n\nPENDING\nPayee FSP has validated the transaction.\n\n\nCOMPLETED\nPayee FSP has successfully performed the transaction.\n\n\nREJECTED\nPayee FSP has failed to perform the transaction.\n\n\n\nTable 103 – Enumeration TransactionState\n4.5.13 TransferState\nTable 104 contains the allowed values for the enumeration TransferState.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRECEIVED\nThe next ledger has received the transfer.\n\n\nRESERVED\nThe next ledger has reserved the transfer.\n\n\nCOMMITTED\nThe next ledger has successfully performed the transfer.\n\n\nABORTED\nThe next ledger has aborted the transfer due a rejection or failure to perform the transfer.\n\n\n\nTable 104 – Enumeration TransferState\n4.6 Error Codes\nEach error code in the API is a four-digit number, such as 1234, where the first number (1 in the example) represents the highlevel error category, the second number (2 in the example) represents the low-level error category, and the last two numbers (34 in the example) represents the specific error. Figure 1 shows the structure of an error code. The following sub-sections contains information and defined error codes per high-level error category.\n\nFigure 1 – Error code structure\nEach defined high- and low-level category combination contains a generic error (x0xx), which can be used if there is no specific error, or if the server would not like to return information which is considered private.\nAll specific errors below xx40, that is, xx00 to xx39, are reserved for future use by the API. All specific errors above and including xx40, can be used for scheme-specific errors. If a client receives an unknown scheme-specific error, the unknown scheme-specific error should be interpreted as a generic error for the high- and low-level category combination instead (xx00).\n4.6.1 Communication Errors – 1xxx\nAll possible communication or network errors that could arise that cannot be represented by an HTTP status code should use\nthe high-level error code 1 (error codes 1xxx). Because all services in the API are asynchronous, these error codes should generally be used by a Switch in the Callback to the client FSP if the Peer FSP could not be reached, or if a callback is not received from the Peer FSP within an agreed timeout.\nLow level categories defined under Communication Errors:\n\nGeneric Communication Error – 10xx\n\nSee Table 105 for all communication errors defined in the API.\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotes\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n1000\nCommunication error\nGeneric communication error.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n1001\nDestination communication error\nThe Destination of the request failed to be reached.

These error codes should indicate that the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the requested service.\nLow-level categories defined under server Errors:\n\nGeneric server Error – 20xx\n\nSee Table 106 for all server errors defined in the API.\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotes\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n2000\nGeneric server error\nGeneric server error to be used for not disclosing information that may be considered private.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n2001\nInternal server error\nA generic unexpected exception.

These error codes should indicate that the server could not perform the service according to the request from the client. The server should provide an explanation why the service could not be performed.\nLow level categories defined under client Errors:\n\nGeneric Client Error – 30xx\nSee Table 107 for the generic client errors defined in the API.\n\n\nValidation Error – 31xx\nSee Table 108 for the validation errors defined in the API.\n\n\nIdentifier Error – 32xx\nSee Table 109 for the identifier errors defined in the API.\n\n\nExpired Error – 33xx\nSee Table 110 for the expired errors defined in the API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotes\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n3000\nGeneric client error\nGeneric client error, to be used for not disclosing information that may be considered private.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n3001\nUnacceptable version requested\nClient requested to use a protocol version which is not supported by the server.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n3002\nUnknown URI\nThe provided URI was unknown by the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3003\nAdd Party information error\nAn error occurred while adding or updating information regarding a Party.\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 107 – Generic client errors – 30xx\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotes\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n3100\nGeneric validation error\nGeneric validation error to be used for not disclosing information that may be considered private.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n3101\nMalformed syntax\nThe format of the parameter is not valid.

Logical API Services\nThe Interoperability API consists of a number of logical API resources. Each resource defines one or more services that clients can use to connect to a server that has implemented the API. This section introduces these services.\nNote: API services identified in this section may not be relevant to (and therefore may not appear in) the generic transaction patterns identified in Section 4. For example, some services are used for provisioning of information, are part of error cases, or are for retrieving information that is not necessary in a generic transaction pattern.\n3.1 Common Functionality\nThis section introduces functionality that is used by more than one logical API resource or service.\n3.1.1 Party Addressing\nA Party is an entity such as an individual, a business, an organization that has a financial account in one of the FSPs. A party is addressed by a combination of an ID type and an ID, and possibly also a subtype or sub ID. Some examples of ID type and ID combinations are:\n\nID type: MSISDN, ID: +123456789\n\nID type: Email, ID: john@doe.com\n\n\n3.1.2 Interledger\nThe API includes basic support for the Interledger Protocol (ILP) by defining a concrete implementation of the Interledger Payment Request protocol1(ILP) in the logical API resources Quotes and Transfers.

Generic Transaction Patterns\nThis section provides information about the three primary transaction patterns defined in the Interoperability API:\n\nPayer-Initiated Transaction\n\nPayee-Initiated Transaction\n\nBulk Transaction\n\n\nEach transaction pattern defines how funds can be transferred from a Payer located in one Financial Service Provider (FSP) to a Payee located in another FSP.\nBoth the Payer-Initiated Transaction and the Payee-Initiated Transaction patterns are intended for a single transfer of funds from one Payer to one Payee. The significant difference between the two patterns is in which of the participants in the transaction is responsible for the initiation of the transaction.\nThe Bulk Transaction pattern should be used when a single Payer would like to transfer funds to multiple Payees, possibly in different FSPs, in a single transaction.\nThis section also provides information about Payee-Initiated Transaction using OTP. which is an alternative to Payee-Initiated Transaction.\nAdditionally, the section provides high-level information about all logical services that are part of the API.\n4.1 Payer-Initiated Transaction\nIn a Payer-Initiated Transaction, the Payer initiates the transaction.\n4.1.1 Business Process Pattern Description\nThe Payer-Initiated Transaction pattern should be used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to another party whose account is not located in the same FSP.\nIn most implementations, Payee involvement is limited to receiving a notification in the event of a successful transaction. Exceptions in which the Payee is more involved are:\n\nIn countries that require the Payee to confirm receipt of funds.\n\nCases in which the Payee should accept the terms of the transaction (for example, Agent-Initiated Cash-In).\n\n\n4.1.2 Participants and Roles\nThe actors in a Payer-Initiated Transaction are:\n\nPayer -- The payer of funds in a financial transaction.\n\nPayee -- The recipient of funds in a financial transaction.\n\n\nThe intermediary objects used in a Payer-Initiated Transaction to perform the transaction are:\n\nPayer FSP -- The FSP in which the Payer's account is located.\n\nSwitch (optional) -- An optional entity used for routing of requests between different FSPs. This object can be removed if requests should be routed directly between a Payer and Payee FSP.\n\nAccount Lookup System -- An entity used for retrieving information regarding accounts or participants. Could be hosted in a separate server, in the Switch, or in the different FSPs.\n\nPayee FSP -- The FSP in which the Payee's account is located.\n\n\n4.1.3 Business Process Sequence Diagram\nFigure 1 shows the UML sequence diagram for a Payer-Initiated Transaction.\n\nFigure 1 -- Payer-Initiated Transaction\n4.1.4 Internal Processing Steps\nThis section provides descriptions of and assumptions made for all steps in the sequence shown in Figure 1.\nLookup Counterparty\n\nDescription\n The Payer initiates the transaction by requesting to send funds to a Payee, using the Payer FSP's front-end API (outside the scope of this API).\n Assumptions\n None.\n\nDescription\n The Payer FSP tries to find the Payee within the FSP system. Because the Payee cannot be found in the Payer FSP system, the request Lookup Party Information is sent by the Payer FSP to the optional Switch to get information regarding the Payee, including in which FSP the Payee is located.\n Assumptions\n The Payee is assumed to be in a different FSP than the Payer. Also, a Switch is assumed to be placed between the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP to route the messages between FSPs. The Switch is optional in the process, as the request Lookup Party Information could also be sent directly to the Payee FSP if there is no Switch in-between. As the Payer FSP should not know in which FSP the Payee is located if there is no Switch present, the request might need to be sent to more than one FSP.\n\nDescription\n The Switch receives the request Lookup Party Information. The Switch then tries to find in which FSP the Payee is located by sending the request Lookup Participant Information to the Account Lookup System.\n Assumptions\n An Account Lookup System is assumed to exist in a different server than the Switch. It is possible that the Account Lookup System is in the same system as the Switch.\n\nDescription\n The Account Lookup System receives the request Lookup Participant Information*. It then performs an internal lookup to find in which FSP the Payee is located. When the lookup is completed, the response *Return Participant Information is sent to inform the Switch about which FSP the Payee is located in.\nAssumptions\n The Payee can be found by the Account Lookup System.\n\nDescription\n The Switch receives the response Return Participant Information. As the Switch now knows in which FSP the Payee is located, the Switch sends the request Lookup Party Information to the Payee FSP to get more information about the Payee.\n Assumptions\n None.\n\nDescription\n The Payee FSP receives the request Lookup Party Information. The Payee FSP then does an internal lookup to find more information regarding the Payee and sends the response Return Party Information to the Switch. \n Assumptions\n None.\n\nDescription\n The Switch receives the response Return Party Information. The Switch then routes the Return Party Information response to the Payer FSP to send the information about the Payee.\n Assumptions\n None.\n\nDescription\n The Payer FSP receives the response Return Party Information containing information about the Payee. \n Assumptions\n None.\n Calculate Quote\n\nDescription\n Depending on the fee model used, the Payer FSP rates the transaction internally and includes the quote information in the request Calculate Quote to a Switch to retrieve the full quote for performing the interoperable financial transaction from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP. The transaction details are sent in the parameters of the request to allow for the Payee FSP to correctly calculate the quote.\n Assumptions\n In this sequence, a Switch is placed between the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP to route the messages. The Switch is optional in the process, as the request Calculate Quote could also be sent directly to the Payee FSP if there is no Switch in-between.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the Calculate Quote request. The Switch then routes the request to the Payee FSP, using the same parameters.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the Calculate Quote request. The Payee FSP then internally calculates the fees or FSP commission for performing the transaction. It then constructs the ILP Packet containing the ILP Address of the Payee, the amount that the Payee will receive, and the transaction details. The fulfilment and the condition are then generated out of the ILP Packet combined with a local secret.\nAssumptions\nNone.\nOptional procedure: Quote Confirmation by Payee\na. Description\nDepending on the use case and the fee model used, the Payee might be informed of the quote in order to confirm the proposed financial transaction. The quote is in that case sent to the Payee using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API). The Payee receives the quote including information regarding the transaction including fees and optionally Payer name. The Payee then confirms the quote using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API), and the Payee FSP receives the confirmation from the Payee. \nAssumptions \nThe Payee is assumed to accept and confirm the quote. If the Payee would reject the quote, an error response would be sent from the Payee FSP to the Payer FSP via the Switch to inform about the rejected quote.\nEnd of Optional procedure\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP uses the response Return Quote Information to the Switch to return information to the Payer FSP about the quote, the ILP Packet, and the condition. The quote has an expiration time, to inform the Payer FSP until which point in time the quote is valid.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Quote Information. The Switch will then route the response to the Payer FSP.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the response Return Quote Information from the Switch. The Payer FSP then informs the Payer using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API) about the total fees to perform the transaction, along with the Payee name.\nAssumptions\nThe total quote can be calculated by the Payer FSP. Also, the Payee name was allowed to be sent during the counterparty lookup (depending on regulation on privacy laws).\n\nDescription\nThe Payer receives the transaction information including fees, taxes and optionally Payee name. If the Payer rejects the transaction, the sequence ends here. \nAssumptions \nThe Payer is assumed to approve the transaction in this sequence. If the Payer would reject the transaction at this stage, no response regarding the rejection is sent to the Payee FSP. The created quote at the Payee FSP should have an expiry time, at which time it is automatically deleted.\nPerform Transfer\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives an approval of the interoperable financial transaction using a front-end API (out of scope of this API). The Payer FSP then performs all applicable internal transaction validations (for example, limit checks, blacklist check, and so on). If the validations are successful, a transfer of funds is reserved from the Payer's account to either a combined Switch account or a Payee FSP account, depending on setup. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request Perform Transfer is sent to the Switch to request the Switch to transfer the funds from the Payer FSP account in the Switch to the Payee FSP account. The request Perform Transfer includes a reference to the earlier quote, an expiry of the transfer, the ILP Packet, and the condition that was received from the Payee FSP. The interoperable financial transaction is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP.\nAssumptions\nInternal validations and reservation are assumed to be successful. In this sequence, a Switch is placed between the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP to route the messages. The Switch is optional in the process, as the request Perform Transfer could also be sent directly to the Payee FSP if there is no Switch in-between.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the request Perform Transfer. The Switch then performs all its applicable internal transfer validations (for example, limit checks blacklist check and so on). If the validations are successful, a transfer is reserved from a Payer FSP account to a Payee FSP account. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request Perform Transfer is sent to the Payee FSP, including the same ILP Packet and condition as was received from the Payer FSP. The expiry time should be decreased by the Switch so that the Payee FSP should answer before the Switch answers to the Payer FSP. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Switch. \nAssumptions\nInternal validations and reservation are successful.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the request Perform Transfer. The Payee FSP then performs all applicable internal transaction validations (for example, limit checks, blacklist check, and so on). It also verifies that the amount and ILP Address in the ILP Packet are correct and match the amount and Payee in the transaction details stored in the ILP Packet. If all the validations are successful, a transfer of funds is performed from either a combined Switch account or a Payer FSP account to the Payee's account and the fulfilment of the condition is regenerated, using the same secret as in Step 11. After the interoperable financial transaction has been successfully performed, a transaction notification is sent to the Payee using a front-end API (out of scope of this API) and the response Return Transfer Information is sent to the Switch, including the regenerated fulfilment. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Payee FSP.\nAssumptions\nInternal validations and transfer of funds are successful.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee receives a transaction notification containing information about the successfully performed transaction. \nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Transfer Information. The Switch then validates the fulfilment and commits the earlier reserved transfer. The Switch then uses the response Return Transfer Information to the Payer FSP, using the same parameters.\nAssumptions\nThe fulfilment is assumed to be correctly validated.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the response Return Transfer Information. The Payer FSP then validates the fulfilment and commits the earlier reserved transaction.\nAssumptions\nThe fulfilment is assumed to be correctly validated.\nOptional fragment: Get Transaction Details\n\nDescription\nIn case the interoperable financial transaction contains additional information that is useful for the Payer or the Payer FSP, such as a code or a voucher token, the Payer FSP can use the request Retrieve Transaction Information to get the additional transaction information. The request Retrieve Transaction Information is sent to the Switch.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the request Retrieve Transaction Information. The Switch then routes the Retrieve Transaction Information request to the Payee FSP.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the request Retrieve Transaction Information. The Payee FSP then collects the requested information and sends the response Return Transaction Information to the Switch.\nAssumptions\nThe transaction with the provided ID can be found in the Payee FSP.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Transaction Information. The Switch then routes the Return Transaction Information response to the Payer FSP.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the response Return Transaction Information.\nAssumptions\nNone.\nEnd of Optional fragment\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP sends a transaction notification to the Payee using a front-end API (out of scope of this API), optionally including transaction details retrieved from the Payee FSP.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer receives a transaction notification containing information about the successfully performed transaction. \nAssumptions\nNone.\n\n\n4.2 Payee-Initiated Transaction\nIn a Payee-Initiated Transaction, the Payee (that is, the recipient of electronic funds) initiates the transaction.\n4.2.1 Business Process Pattern Description\nThe pattern should be used whenever a Payee would like to receive funds from another party whose account is not located in the same FSP.\nIn all alternatives to this pattern, the Payer must in some way confirm the request of funds. Some possible alternatives for confirming the request are:\n\nManual approval -- A transaction request is routed from the Payee to the Payer, the Payer can then either approve or reject the transaction.\n\nPre-approval of Payee -- A Payer can pre-approve a specific Payee to request funds, used for automatic approval of, for example, school fees or electric bills.\n\n\nAnother alternative for approval is to use the business pattern Payee-Initiated Transaction using OTP, described in Section 4.3.\n4.2.2 Participants and Roles\nThe actors in a Payee-Initiated Transaction are:\n\nPayer -- The payer of funds in a financial transaction.\n\nPayee -- The recipient of funds in a financial transaction.\n\n\nThe intermediary objects used in a Payee-Initiated Transaction to perform the transaction are:\n\nPayer FSP -- The FSP in which the Payer's account is located.\n\nSwitch (optional) -- An optional entity used for routing of requests between different FSPs. This object can be removed if requests should be routed directly between a Payer and Payee FSP.\n\nAccount Lookup System -- An entity used for retrieving information regarding accounts or participants. Could be hosted in a separate server, in the Switch, or in the different FSPs.\n\nPayee FSP -- The FSP in which the Payee's account is located.\n\n\n4.2.3 Business Process Sequence Diagram\nFigure 2 shows the UML sequence diagram for a Payee-Initiated Transaction.\n\nFigure 2 -- Payee-Initiated Transaction\n4.2.4 Internal Processing Steps\nThis section provides descriptions of and assumptions made for all steps in the sequence shown in Figure 2.\nLookup Counterparty\n\nDescription\n The Payee initiates the transaction by requesting to receive funds from a Payer, using the Payee FSP's front-end API (outside the scope of this API).\n Assumptions\n None.\n\nDescription\n The Payee FSP tries to find the Payer within the FSP system. Because the Payer cannot be found in the Payee FSP system, the Payee FSP sends the request to the optional Account Lookup System to get information regarding in which FSP the Payer is located.\n Assumptions\n The Payer is assumed to be located in a different FSP than the Payee. Also, an Account Lookup System is assumed to exist. The Account Lookup System is optional in the process, as the request Lookup Participant Information could also be sent directly to the Payer FSP if there is no Account Lookup System. As the Payee FSP should not know in which FSP the Payer is located if there is no Account Lookup System present, the request might need to be sent to more than one FSP. It is also possible that the Payee FSP would like more information about the Payer before a transaction request is sent; in that case the request Lookup Party Information, either to the Switch or directly to the Payer FSP, should be sent instead of Lookup Participant Information to the Account Lookup System.\n\nDescription\n The Account Lookup System receives the Lookup Participant Information. It then performs an internal lookup to find in which FSP the Payer is located. When the lookup is completed, the response Return Participant Information is sent to inform the Payee FSP about which FSP the Payer is located.\n Assumptions\n The Payer can be found by the Account Lookup System.\n\nDescription\n The Payee FSP receives the response Return Participant Information.\n Assumptions\n None.\n Transaction Request\n\nDescription\n The Payee FSP sends the request Perform Transaction Request to the Switch. The request contains the transaction details including the amount that the Payee would like to receive.\n Assumptions\n In this sequence, a Switch is placed between the Payee FSP and the Payer FSP to route the messages. The Switch is optional in the process, as the request Perform Transaction Request could also be sent directly to the Payer FSP if there is no Switch in-between.\n\nDescription\n The Switch receives the Request Transaction. The Switch then routes the request to the Payer FSP, using the same parameters.\n Assumptions\n None.\n\nDescription\n The Payer FSP receives the request Perform Transaction Request. The Payer FSP then optionally validates the transaction request (for example, whether the Payer exists) and uses the response Return Transaction Request Information to inform the Payee FSP via the Switch that the transaction request has been received. \n Assumptions \n The optional validation succeeds.\n\nDescription\n The Switch receives the response Return Transaction Request Information. The Switch then sends the same response (Return Transaction Request Information) to inform the Payee FSP about the successfully delivered transaction request to the Payer FSP.\n Assumptions \n None. \n\nDescription\n The Payee FSP receives the response Return Transaction Request Information from the Switch. \n Assumptions \n None.\n Calculate Quote\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP rates the transaction internally based on the fee model used and includes the quote information in the request Calculate Quote to a Switch to retrieve the full quote for performing the interoperable financial transaction from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP. The transaction details, including a reference to the earlier sent transaction request, are sent in the parameters of the request to allow for the Payee FSP to correctly calculate the quote. \nAssumptions \nIn this sequence, a Switch is placed between the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP to route the messages. The Switch is optional in the process, as the request Calculate Quote could also be sent directly to the Payee FSP if there is no Switch in-between. \n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the Calculate Quote request. The Switch then routes the request to the Payee FSP. \nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the Calculate Quote request. The Payee FSP then internally calculates the fees or FSP commission for performing the transaction. It then constructs the ILP Packet containing the ILP Address of the Payee, the amount that the Payee will receive, and the transaction details. The fulfilment and the condition are then generated out of the ILP Packet combined with a local secret.\nAssumptions\nNone\n\nDescription\nDepending on use case and the fee model used, the Payee might be informed of the quote so that the Payee can confirm the proposed financial transaction. The quote is in that case sent to the Payee using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API). The Payee receives the quote including information regarding the transaction including fees and optionally Payer name. The Payee then confirms the quote using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API). The Payee FSP receives the confirmation from the Payee.\nAssumptions\nThe quote is assumed to be sent to the Payer for confirmation, and the Payee is assumed to accept and confirm the quote. If the Payee would reject the quote, an error response would be sent from the Payee FSP to the Payer FSP via the Switch to inform about the rejected quote.\nEnd of Optional fragment\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP uses the response Return Quote Information to the Switch to return information to the Payer FSP about the quote, the ILP Packet, and the condition. The quote has an expiration time, to inform the Payer FSP until which point in time the quote is valid.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Quote Information. The Switch then routes the response to the Payer FSP.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the response Return Quote Information from the Switch. The Payer FSP then informs the Payer using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API) about the transaction request from the Payee, including the amount and the total fees required to perform the transaction, along with the Payee name. \nAssumptions\nThe total quote can be calculated by the Payer FSP. Also, the Payee name was allowed to be sent during the counterparty lookup (depending on regulation on privacy laws).\n\nDescription\nThe Payer receives the transaction request information including fees, taxes and optionally Payee name. \nAssumptions\nIf the Payer rejects the transaction request, the sequence proceeds to Step 18. If the Payer approves the transaction request, the sequence proceeds to Step 22.\nAlternative: Transaction Rejection\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the rejection of the transaction request using a front-end API (out of scope of this API). The Payer FSP then uses the response Return Transaction Request Information with a rejected status to inform the Switch that the transaction was rejected.\nAssumptions\nThe Payer is assumed to reject the transaction request in Step 17.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Transaction Request Information from the Payer FSP. The Switch then routes the response Return Transaction Request Information to the Payee FSP.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the response Return Transaction Request Information with a rejected status from the Switch. The Payee FSP then informs the Payee using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API) about the rejected transaction request.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee receives the notification that the transaction was rejected. The process ends here as the transaction request was rejected and the Payee has been informed of the decision.\nAssumptions\nNone.\nAlternative: Perform Transfer\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives an approval of the interoperable financial transaction using a front-end API (out of scope of this API). The Payer FSP then performs all applicable internal transaction validations (for example, limit checks, blacklist check, and so on). If the validations are successful, a transfer of funds is reserved from the Payer's account to either a combined Switch account or a Payee FSP account, depending on setup. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request Perform Transfer is sent to the Switch to request the Switch to transfer the funds from the Payer FSP account in the Switch to the Payee FSP account. The request Perform Transfer includes a reference to the earlier quote, an expiry of the transfer, the ILP Packet, and the condition that was received from the Payee FSP. The interoperable financial transaction is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP.\nAssumptions\nThe Payer is assumed to approve the transaction request in Step 17. Internal validations and reservation are assumed to be successful. In this sequence, a Switch is placed between the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP to route the messages. The Switch is optional in the process, as the request Perform Transfer could also be sent directly to the Payee FSP if there is no Switch in-between.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the request Perform Transfer. The Switch then performs all its applicable internal transfer validations (for example, limit checks, blacklist check, and so on). If the validations are successful, a transfer is reserved from a Payer FSP account to a Payee FSP account. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request Perform Transfer is sent to the Payee FSP, including the same ILP Packet and condition as was received from the Payer FSP. The expiry time should be decreased by the Switch, so that the Payee FSP should answer before the Switch should answer to the Payer FSP. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Switch. \nAssumptions\nInternal validations and reservation are successful.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the request Perform Transfer. The Payee FSP then performs all applicable internal transaction validations (for example, limit checks, blacklist check, and so on). It also verifies that the amount and ILP Address in the ILP Packet are correct and match the amount and Payee in the transaction details stored in the ILP Packet. If all the validations are successful, a transfer of funds is performed from either a combined Switch account or a Payer FSP account to the Payee's account and the fulfilment of the condition is regenerated, using the same secret as in Step 11. After the interoperable financial transaction has been successfully performed, a transaction notification is sent to the Payee using a front-end API (out of scope of this API) and the response Return Transfer Information is sent to the Switch, including the regenerated fulfilment. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Payee FSP.\nAssumptions\nInternal validations and transfer of funds are successful.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee receives a transaction notification containing information about the successfully performed transaction. \nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Transfer Information.

The Payer FSP then validates the fulfilment and commits the earlier reserved transaction.\nAssumptions\nThe fulfilment is assumed to be correctly validated.\nOptional fragment: Get Transaction Details\n\nDescription\nIn case the interoperable financial transaction contains additional information that is useful for the Payer or the Payer FSP; for example, a code or a voucher token, the Payer FSP can use the request Retrieve Transaction Information to get the additional information. The request Retrieve Transaction Information is sent to the Switch.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the request Retrieve Transaction Information. The Switch then routes the request Retrieve Transaction Information to the Payee FSP.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the request Retrieve Transaction Information. The Payee FSP then collects the requested information and uses the response Return Transaction Information to the Switch. \nAssumptions\nThe transaction with the provided ID can be found in the Payee FSP.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Transaction Information.

An alternative to user- initiated creation of OTP is that the OTP is automatically generated and sent by the Payer FSP. The same OTP is then entered by the Payer in a Payee device, usually a POS device or an ATM. The OTP in the transaction request is automatically matched by the Payer FSP to either approve or reject the transaction. The OTP does not need to be encrypted as it should only be valid once during a short time period.\n\n4.3.2 Participants and Roles\nThe actors in a Payee-Initiated Transaction using OTP are:\n\nPayer -- The payer of funds in a financial transaction.\n\nPayee -- The recipient of funds in a financial transaction.\n\n\nThe intermediary objects used in a Payee-Initiated Transaction using OTP to perform the transaction are:\n\nPayer FSP -- The FSP in which the Payer's account is located.\n\nSwitch (optional) -- An optional entity used for routing of requests between different FSPs. This object can be removed if requests should be routed directly between a Payer and Payee FSP.\n\nAccount Lookup System -- An entity used for retrieving information regarding accounts or participants. Could be hosted in a separate server, in the Switch, or in the different FSPs.\n\nPayee FSP -- The FSP in which the Payee's account is located.\n\n\n4.3.3 Business Process Sequence Diagram\nFigure 3 shows the UML sequence diagram for a Payee-Initiated Transaction using OTP.\n\nFigure 3 -- Payee-Initiated Transaction using OTP\n4.3.4 Internal Processing Steps\nThis section provides descriptions of and assumptions made for all steps in the sequence shown in Figure 3.\nOptional fragment: Manual OTP request\n\nDescription\n The Payer requests that an OTP be generated, using the Payer FSP's front-end API (outside the scope of this API).\n Assumptions\n There are two alternatives for generating an OTP; either it is generated upon request by the Payer (this option), or it is automatically generated in Step 19.\n\nDescription\n The Payer FSP receives the request to generate an OTP and returns a generated OTP to the Payer, using the Payer FSP's front-end API (outside the scope of this API).\n Assumptions\n None.\n\nDescription\n Payer receives the generated OTP. The OTP can then be used by the Payer in Step 25 for automatic approval. \n Assumptions\n None.\n End of Optional fragment\n Lookup Counterparty\n\nDescription\n The Payee initiates the transaction by requesting to receive funds from a Payer, using the Payee FSP's front-end API (outside the scope of this API). \n Assumptions \n None.\n\nDescription\n The Payee FSP tries to find the Payer within the FSP system. Because the Payer cannot be found in the Payee FSP system, the request Lookup Participant Information is sent by the Payee FSP to the optional Account Lookup System to get information regarding in which FSP the Payer is located. \n Assumptions \n The Payer is assumed to be in a different FSP than the Payee. Also, an Account Lookup System is assumed to exist. The Account Lookup System is optional in the process, as the request Lookup Participant Information could also be sent directly to the Payer FSP if there is no Account Lookup System. As the Payee FSP should not know in which FSP the Payer is located if there is no Account Lookup System present, the request might need to be sent to more than one FSP.

The Payee FSP then internally calculates the fees or FSP commission for performing the transaction. It then constructs the ILP Packet containing the ILP Address of the Payee, the amount that the Payee will receive, and the transaction details. The fulfilment and the condition is then generated out of the ILP Packet combined with a local secret. \nAssumptions\nNone.\nOptional fragment: Quote Confirmation by Payee\n\nDescription\nDepending on the fee model used and which use case it is, the Payee might be informed of the quote to be able to confirm the proposed financial transaction. The quote is in that case sent to the Payee using a front- end API (outside the scope of this API. The Payee receives the quote including information regarding the transaction including fees and optionally Payer name. The Payee then confirms the quote using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API). The Payee FSP receives the confirmation from the Payee. \nAssumptions \nThe quote is assumed to be sent to the Payer for confirmation, and the Payee is assumed to accept and confirm the quote.

The Switch will then route the request to the Payer FSP. \nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the response Return Quote Information from the Switch. \nAssumptions \nThe total quote can be calculated by the Payer FSP.\nOptional fragment: Automatic OTP generation\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP automatically generates an OTP and sends it to the Payer, using the Payer FSP's front-end API (outside the scope of this API).\nAssumptions \nThere are two alternatives for generating the OTP. Either it is generated upon request by the Payer (Step 1), or it is automatically generated (this option).\n\nDescription\nThe Payer receives the automatically-generated OTP. \nAssumptions\nNone.\nEnd of Optional fragment\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP sends the request Perform Authorization to the Switch, to get an authorization to perform the transaction from the Payer via a POS, ATM, or similar payment device, in the Payee FSP. The request includes the amount to be withdrawn from the Payer's account, and how many retries are left for the Payer to retry the OTP. \nAssumptions \nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the request Perform Authorization from the Payer FSP. The Switch then routes the Perform Authorization to the Payee FSP. \nAssumptions \nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the request Perform Authorization from the Switch.

The Switch then routes the Return Authorization Result to the Payer FSP. \nAssumptions \nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the request Return Authorization Result to the Switch. The Payer FSP then validates the OTP received from the OTP generated in Step 2 or Step 20. If the Payer FSP is unable to validate the OTP (for example, because the OTP is incorrect) and this was the last remaining retry for the Payer, the sequence continues with Step 29. If the Payer FSP correctly validates the OTP, the sequence continues with Step 33. \nAssumptions \nNone.\nAlternative: OTP validation failed\n\nDescription\nThe validation in Step 28 fails and this was the final retry for the Payer.

Also, an Account Lookup System is assumed to exist. The Account Lookup System is optional in the process, as the request Lookup Participant Information could also be sent directly to the Payee FSPs if there is no Account Lookup System. As the Payer FSP should not know in which FSP the Payee is located in if there is no Account Lookup System present, the request might need to be sent to more than one FSP. It is also possible that the Payer FSP would like more information about the Payee before a bulk transaction is executed; for example, for additional verification purposes of the Payee name. In that case, the request Lookup Party Information, either to the Switch or directly to the Payee FSP, should be sent instead of the request Lookup Participant Information to the Account Lookup System.\n\nDescription\n The Account Lookup System receives the request Lookup Participant Information.

The Switch then routes the request to the Payee FSP, using the same parameters.\n Assumptions \n None.\n\nDescription\n The Payee FSP receives the Calculate Bulk Quote request. The Payee FSP then internally calculates the fees or FSP commission for performing each individual transaction in the bulk transaction. For each individual transaction, the Payee FSP then constructs an ILP Packet containing the ILP Address of the Payee, the amount that the Payee will receive, and the transaction details. The fulfilment and the condition is then generated out of the ILP Packet combined with a local secret. It then uses the response Return Bulk Quote Information to the Switch to inform the Payer FSP about the fees involved in performing the bulk transaction and the ILP Packet and condition. The bulk quote has an expiration date and time, to inform the Payer FSP until which time the bulk quote is valid. \n Assumptions \n The bulk quote can be calculated by the Payee FSP.\n\nDescription\n The Switch receives the response Return Bulk Quote Information. The Switch then routes the response to the Payer FSP. \n Assumptions \n None.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the response Return Bulk Quote Information from the Switch. \nAssumptions \nNone.\nEnd of loop for each Payee FSP\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP calculates any internal bulk fees and taxes, and informs the Payer using a front-end API (outside the scope of this API) about the total fees and taxes to perform the bulk transaction.\nAssumptions\nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer receives the notification about the completed processing of the bulk transaction and the fees and taxes to perform the bulk transaction. The Payer then decides to execute the bulk transaction.\nAssumptions \nThe Payer is assumed to execute the bulk transaction. If the Payer would reject the bulk transaction at this stage, no response is sent to the Payee FSP. The created bulk quote at the Payee FSPs should have an expiry date; that is, at which time it's automatically deleted.\nPerform Bulk Transfer\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the request to execute the bulk transaction from the Payer. \nAssumptions \nNone.\nLoop for each Payee FSP to perform Bulk Transfer\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP performs all applicable internal transaction validations (for example, limit checks, blacklist check, and so on) for the bulk transaction to the Payee FSP. If the validations are successful, a transfer of funds is reserved from the Payer's account to either a combined Switch account or a Payee FSP account, depending on setup. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request Perform Bulk Transfer is sent to the Switch. The request Perform Bulk Transfer includes a reference to the earlier bulk quote, an expiry of the bulk transfer, and the ILP Packets and condition per transfer that was received from the Payee FSP. The interoperable financial transaction is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP. The interoperable bulk transaction is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP. \nAssumptions \nIn this sequence, a Switch is placed between the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP to route the messages. The Switch is optional in the process, as the request Perform Bulk Transfer could also be sent directly to the Payee FSP if there is no Switch in-between.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the request Perform Bulk Transfer. The Switch then performs all applicable internal transfer validations (such as limit checks, blacklist check, and so on). If the validations are successful, a transfer is reserved from a Payer FSP account to a Payee FSP account. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request Perform Bulk Transfer is sent to the Payee FSP, including the same ILP Packets and conditions for each transfer that were received from the Payer FSP. The expiry time should be decreased by the Switch so that the Payee FSP should answer before the Switch should answer to the Payer FSP. The bulk transfer is now irrevocable from the Switch. \nAssumptions \nInternal validations and reservation are successful.\n\nDescription\nThe Payee FSP receives the request Perform Bulk Transfer. The Payee FSP then performs all applicable internal transaction validations (such as limit checks, and blacklist checks) for each individual transaction in the bulk transaction. If the validations are successful, a transfer of funds is performed from either a combined Switch account or a Payer FSP account, depending on setup, to each of the Payees' accounts and the fulfilment of each condition is regenerated, using the same secret as in Step 8. After each transfer to a Payee has been successfully performed, a transaction notification is sent to the Payee using a front-end API (out of scope of this API). After each of the individual transactions in the bulk transaction has been completed, the response Return Bulk Transfer Information is sent to the Switch to inform the Switch and the Payer FSP of the result including each fulfilment. The transactions in the bulk transaction are now irrevocable from the Payee FSP.\nAssumptions \nInternal validations and transfers of funds are successful.\n\nDescription\nEach Payee receives a transaction notification containing information about the successfully performed transaction. \nAssumptions \nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Switch receives the response Return Bulk Transfer Information. The Switch then validates the fulfilments and commits the earlier reserved transfers. The Switch then uses the response Return Bulk Transfer Information to the Payer FSP, using the same parameters.\nAssumptions \nEach individual transaction in the bulk transaction is assumed to be successful in the Payee FSP, and the validation of the fulfilments is also assumed to be correct. If one or more of the transactions in the bulk transaction were unsuccessful, the earlier reserved, now unsuccessful, transfer or transfers in the Switch would need to be cancelled.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer FSP receives the response Return Bulk Transfer Information. The Payer FSP then commits the earlier reserved transfers. After the bulk transaction has been successfully committed, a transaction notification is sent to the Payer using a front-end API (out of scope of this API). \nAssumptions \nEach individual transaction in the bulk transaction is assumed to be successful in the Payee FSP, and the validation of the fulfilments is also assumed to be correct. If one or more of the transactions in the bulk transaction were unsuccessful, the earlier reserved transfer in the Payer FSP would need to be updated with the total amount of all successful transactions before being committed.\nEnd of loop for each Payee FSP\n\nDescription\nAfter each of the Payee FSPs has executed their part of the bulk transaction, a response is sent to the Payer using a front- end API (out of scope for this API). \nAssumptions \nNone.\n\nDescription\nThe Payer receives a bulk transaction notification containing information about the successfully performed bulk transaction.\nAssumptions \nNone.\n\n\n5.

Introduction\nThe purpose of this document is to define a set of use cases that can be implemented using the Open API for FSP interoperability (hereafter cited as the API). The use cases referenced within this document provide an overview of transaction processing flows and business rules of each transaction step as well as relevant error conditions.\nThe primary purpose of the API is to support the movement of financial transactions between one Financial Services Provider (FSP) and another.\nIt should be noted that the API is only responsible for message exchange between FSPs and a Switch when a cross-FSP transaction is initiated by an End User in one of the FSPs. This can occur in either of two scenarios:\n\nA bilateral scenario in which FSPs communicate with each other\n\nA Switch based scenario in which all communication goes through a Switch\n\n\nReconciliation, clearing and settlement after real time transactions is out of scope for the API. Additionally, account lookup is supported by the API, but it relies on the implementation in a local market in which a third party or Switch would provide such services. Therefore, the need for effective on-boarding processes and appropriate scheme rules must be considered when implementing use cases.\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\n\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\n\nUse Cases\n\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\n\nJSON Binding Rules\n\nScheme Rules\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\n\nSignature\n\nEncryption\n\n\n3. Use Case Summaries\nThe following generic transaction patterns are introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns to reduce duplication of each use case description. These patterns summarize the common transaction process flows and shared function of the relevant use cases.\n\nPayer-Initiated Transaction\n\nIn a Payer-Initiated Transaction, it is the Payer (that is, the payer of electronic funds) who initiates the transaction.\nThe pattern should be used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to another party whose account is not located in the same FSP.\n\n\n\nPayee-Initiated Transaction\n\nIn a Payee-Initiated Transaction, it is the Payee (that is, the recipient of electronic funds) who initiates the transaction.\nThis pattern should be used whenever a Payee would like to receive funds from another party whose account is not located in the same FSP.\n\n\n\nPayee-Initiated Transaction using OTP\n\nA Payee-Initiated Transaction using One-Time Password (OTP) is like a Payee-Initiated Transaction, but the transaction information (including fees and taxes) and approval for the Payer is shown or entered on a Payee device instead.\n\nThis pattern should be used when a Payee would like to receive funds from another party whose account is not located in the same FSP, and both the transaction information (including fees and taxes) and approval is shown or entered on a Payee device instead.\n\n\n\nBulk Transactions\n\nIn a Bulk Transaction, it is the Payer (that is, the sender of funds) who initiates multiple transactions to multiple Payees, potentially located in different FSPs.\n\nThe pattern should be used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to multiple Payees in the same transaction. The Payees can potentially be in different FSPs.\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to read all Generic Transaction Patterns before reading the use cases. For more information, see Generic Transaction Patterns.\nEach use case describes variations on and special considerations for the generic transaction pattern to which it refers. The use cases are introduced in Table 1.\n\n\n\nUse Case Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nP2P\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which an individual End User initiates a transaction to send money to another individual End User who doesn’t belong to the same FSP as the Payer.This is usually a remote transaction in which Payer and Payee are not in the same location.\n\n\nAgent-Initiated Cash-In\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which a customer requests an agent of a different FSP to cash-in (deposit funds) to their account.This is typically a face-to-face transaction in which the customer and the agent are in the same location.\n\n\nAgent-Initiated Cash-Out\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which a customer requests that an agent of a different FSP to cash-out (withdraw funds) from their account.This is typically a face-to-face transaction in which the customer and the agent are in the same location.\n\n\nAgent-Initiated Cash-Out Authorized on POS\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which a customer requests an agent of a different FSP to cash-out (withdraw funds) from their account. In this use case, the agent initiates the transaction through a point-of-sale (POS) and the customer inputs OTP on POS to authorize the transaction. Alternatively, the agent can use POS to scan a QR code generated by a customer’s mobile app to initiate the transaction.\n\n\nCustomer-Initiated Cash-Out\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which a registered customer initiates a transaction to cash-out (withdraw funds) using an agent who doesn’t belong to the customer’s FSP.This is typically a face-to-face transaction in which the customer and the agent are in the same location.\n\n\nCustomer-Initiated MerchantPayment\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which an individual End User initiates a purchase transaction to pay a merchant who does not belong to the same FSP as the customer.This is usually a face to face transaction when a customer buys goods or services at a merchant store.A variant of this use case is online payment, in which the online shopping system generates a QR code and displays it on a web page, and the consumer then scans the QR code by handset and completes the payment transaction.\n\n\nMerchant-Initiated MerchantPayment\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which a merchant initiates a request for payment to the customer; the customer reviews the transaction amount in the request and confirms the request by providing authentication on their own handset.\n\n\nMerchant-Initiated MerchantPayment Authorized on POS\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which merchant initiates a request for payment from the customer; the customer reviews the payment request on a merchant device and authorizes the payment by OTP or QR code on the merchant device. The customer authentication information is sent from Payee FSP to Payer FSP for authentication by Payer FSP.\n\n\nATM-Initiated Cash-Out\nThis use case describes the business process and business rules in which an ATM initiates a cash-out request from a customer account. Customer pregenerates an OTP for cash-out and uses this OTP on the ATM device to initiate ATM cash-out. The Payer FSP validates the OTP received in the ATM-Initiated Cash-Out request for authentication purposes.\n\n\nBulk Payments\nBulk Payments is used when an organization or business is paying out funds – for example, aid or salary to multiple Payees who have accounts located in the different FSPs. The organization or business can group transactions together to make it easier for uploading and validating individual transactions in bulk before the bulk transaction is executed. It is also possible for the organization to follow up the result of the individual transactions in the bulk transaction after the bulk transaction is executed.\n\n\nRefund\nThis use case describes the business flow how to refund a completed interoperability transaction.\n\n\n\nTable 1 – Use Case Summary\n4. Use Cases\nThis section demonstrates ways in which the API can be used through the use cases identified in Table 1 – Use Case Summary.\nFor each use case, the following is presented:\n\nUse Case Description\nReference to Generic Pattern\nActors and Roles\nAddition to Generic Transaction Pattern\nRelevant Error Conditions\n\n4.1 P2P\n4.1.1 Use Case Description\nThis section describes the business process and business rules for a use case in which an individual End User initiates a transaction to send money to another individual End User who doesn’t belong to the same FSP as the Payer.\nThis is usually a remote transaction in which Payer and Payee are not in the same location. \nThere are four steps necessary to complete a P2P Transfer transaction from one FSP user to another FSP user.\n4.1.1.1 Step 1\nPayer initiates a transaction to their FSP, and Payer FSP then locates Payee FSP through an API call to the Account Lookup System or by the agreed-upon scheme rules.\n4.1.1.2 Step 2\nPayer FSP calculates the transaction fee applied to Payer. Payer FSP sends a quote request through an API call to Payee FSP.\n4.1.1.3 Step 3\nPayer FSP presents the total transaction fee and Payee name (optional) to the Payer to confirm the transaction.\n4.1.1.4 Step 4\nPayer accepts the transaction and Payer FSP performs the transaction through an API call to the Switch or to Payee FSP. The transaction completes and notifications are sent to both Payer and Payee; or the Payer rejects the transaction and the transaction ends.\n4.1.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayer-Initiated Transaction\n4.1.3 Actors and Roles\nThe actors and roles for P2P are described in Table 2.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction Pattern\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nPayer\nAn individual who is a registered customer of an FSP who initiates a transaction to send money to another individual.\n\n\nCustomer\nPayee\nThe person who will receive money from Payer.Payee could be a registered customer of Payee FSP or, if the scheme rules allow it, an unregistered customer who will be registered during the transaction process, which is determined by the design of Payee FSP.\n\n\n\nTable 2 – P2P Actors and Roles\n4.1.4 Addition to Generic Transaction Pattern\n4.1.4.1 Step 2\nThe Payee FSP ID could be determined by the scheme rule without any dependence on the API. Otherwise, Lookup Party Information request is an option for determining in which FSP a Payee is located.\nPayer FSP will use the request Lookup Party Information to retrieve details of Payee from Payee FSP directly if there is no Switch between Payer FSP and Payee FSP.\n4.1.4.2 Steps 9 – Step 15\nIn the current version of the API, the Calculate Quote request to Payee FSP is mandatory even if a wholesale fee is agreed upon in the scheme. Payee FSP needs to receive transaction details from the Calculate Quote request to generate the condition for this transaction.\nPayer FSP can use information from response Return Quote Information from Payee FSP to calculate the transaction fee it will apply on Payer. The business rules for how Payer FSP calculates the transaction fee could be defined by the scheme rules; this is out of scope for the API.\nIn P2P Transfer case, it is the common practice that Payer pays the entire transaction fee, and Payee is free of charge in the transaction.\n4.1.4.3 Step 16\nThere are several ways to push a confirmation message to Payer to authorize the transaction. For example, USSD Push Message, or SMSC notification; then Payer opens the USSD menu to query and confirm the pending transaction\nThe interaction between Payer and Payer FSP is designed by each FSP, and is out-of-scope for the API.\n4.1.4.4 Step 19\nThe Quote ID applied in the previous step is verified in the transaction processing step. If the quote is expired, Payee FSP will reject the transaction.\n4.1.4.5 Step 20\nA notification is sent to the Payee once the transaction is performed by Payee FSP.\n4.1.4.6 Step 28\nPayer FSP sends notification to Payer to indicate the transaction result.\n4.1.5 Relevant Error Conditions\nTable 3 describes relevant errors and recommended follow-up actions for this use case. \n\n\n\nStep\nError Condition\nError Description\nFollow Up Action\n\n\n\n\n2\nTimeout\nLookup Party Information request timed out\nRetry\n\n\n4\nPayee is unreachable\nAccount Lookup System fails to locate Payee\nCancel the transaction\n\n\n6\nCurrency is not supported\nThe transaction currency is not supported.\nInitiate a new transaction with supported currency by Payee FSP\n\n\n9\nTimeout\nCalculate Quote request timed out\nRetry with the same ID\n\n\n11\nWrong quote\nPayee FSP cannot provide quote due to internal business rule validation failure or system error.For example, invalid account status of Payee, wrong fee configuration or database error\nCancel the transaction\n\n\n17\nTimeout\nPerform Transfer request timed out\nQuery transaction status and decide to complete or retryThe retry policy will be defined by the scheme rules.

This is a two-step transaction: Agent initiates a cash-in transaction from their handset or POS and then receives transaction information including possible fees. Agent can either approve or reject the transaction. Once transaction is completed, the customer gives cash to the agent.\nAgent-Initiated Cash-In is typically a face-to-face transaction in which the customer and the agent are in the same location.\n4.2.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayer-Initiated Transaction\n4.2.3 Actors and Roles\nThe actors and roles for Agent-Initiated Cash-In are described in Table 4.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction Pattern\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAgent\nPayer\nPayer is an agent (individual or organization) who will receive cash from the customer and transfer money to the customer’s account.

This is a 2-step transaction, the agent initiates cash-out transaction request and the customer authorizes the transaction on their handset. Once transaction is completed, the agent gives cash to the customer.\nAgent-Initiated Cash-Out is a face-to-face transaction in which the customer and the agent are in the same location.\n4.3.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayee-Initiated Transaction\n4.3.3 Actors and Roles\nThe actors and roles for Agent-Initiated Cash-Out are described in Table 6.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to GenericTransaction Pattern\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nPayer\nPayer is a customer (individual or organization) who wants to withdraw cash using an agent.Customer is a registered party in Payer FSP.\n\n\nAgent\nPayee\nPayee is an agent registered with the Payee FSP.

In this use case, the agent initiates the transaction through a POS, and the customer inputs a OTP on POS to authorize the transaction. Alternatively, the agent can use POS to scan a QR code generated by the mobile app of the customer to initiate the transaction.\n\nApproval using OTP – A Payer can approve a transaction by first creating an OTP in their FSP. The OTP is then entered in a Payee device (usually a POS device). The OTP in the transaction request is automatically matched by the Payer FSP to either approve or reject the transaction. The OTP does not need to be encrypted as it should only be valid once during a short time period.\n\nApproval using QR code – A Payer can approve a transaction by requesting a Payer FSP to generate a QR code that encodes an OTP and customer’s identifier.\n\nApproval using NFC – A Payer can approve a transaction by swiping a Near Field Communication (NFC) phone on a POS. The interoperability for NFC POS of one FSP to read data from NFC tag or NFC phone of another FSP should be considered if NFC technology is adopted.\n\n\nAgent-Initiated Cash-Out Authorized on POS is typically a face-to-face transaction in which the customer and the agent are in the same location.\n4.4.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayee-Initiated Transaction using OTP\n4.4.3 Actors and Roles\nThe actors and roles for Agent-Initiated Cash-Out Authorized on POS are described in Table 8.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction Pattern\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nPayer\nPayer is a customer (individual or organization) who wants to withdraw cash using an agent.The customer is a registered party with Payer FSP.\n\n\nAgent\nPayee\nPayee is an agent registered with the Payee FSP.

Another case is online payment, in which an online shopping system generates a QR code and displays on the web page, and the customer then scans the QR code on the web page and authorizes and completes the payment transaction on their handset.\nAssumption: Encoding/Decoding QR code is handled in each FSP and is out of scope of API. The data and its format encoded in the QR code should be defined in the scheme rules to enable QR codes to be interoperable.\n4.6.2 Reference to General Pattern\nPayer-Initiated Transaction\n4.6.3 Actors and Roles\nThe actors and roles for Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment are described in Table 12.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction Pattern\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nPayer\nAn individual End User of one FSP who buys goods or service from a merchant of another FSP.\n\n\nMerchant\nPayee\nThe business that sells goods or provide service and then receives payment from the customer.\n\n\n\nTable 12 – Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment: Actors and Roles\n4.6.4 Addition to Generic Transaction Pattern\n4.6.4.1 Step 1\nFor feature phone:\n\nThe customer can initiate a payment transaction by inputting relevant payment information on the USSD menu, such as amount and merchant ID.\n\nFor smart phone:\n\nThe customer initiates merchant payment transaction by scanning the merchant QR code. After resolving the merchant QR code, there are two scenarios:\na) The customer inputs transaction amount in their handset to continue the transaction if the transaction amount is not encoded in the QR code. This is the case for face-to-face payment at retailer merchant store.\nb) Transaction amount has already been encoded in the QR code, and then Payer FSP has enough information to continue the transaction. This case then follows the process of the online payment case identified in 4.6.1.\n\n\n4.6.4.2 Step 2\nThe merchant FSP ID could be determined by the scheme rules without depending on an Account Lookup System. Otherwise, Lookup Party Information request is an option to find out in which FSP the merchant is located.\nIn most cases, the merchant FSP ID is captured during initiating the transaction. For example, the customer selects the merchant FSP from USSD menu, or it is already encoded in the merchant QR code.\n4.6.4.3 Step 9 – Step 15\nIn most cases, the customer is free of charge for the purchase transaction. Calculate Quote request is still necessary, because all transaction details will be sent to Payee FSP and the condition of the transfer will be generated by Payee FSP for later use (in Perform Transfer).\n4.6.4.4 Step 20\nA notification is sent to the merchant once the transaction is performed by the Payee FSP.\n4.6.4.5 Step 29\nCustomer receives transaction notification and customer receives goods.\n4.6.5 Relevant Error Conditions\nTable 13 describes relevant errors and recommended follow-up actions for this use case.\n\n\n\nStep\nError Condition\nError Description\nFollow Up Action\n\n\n\n\n2\nTimeout\nLookup Party Information request timed out\nRetry\n\n\n4\nMerchant is unreachable\nAccount Lookup System fails to locate merchant\nCancel the transaction\n\n\n6\nCurrency is not supported\nThe transaction currency is not supported.\nInitiate a new transaction with supported currency by Payee FSP\n\n\n9\nTimeout\nCalculate Quote request timed out\nRetry with the same ID\n\n\n11\nWrong quote\nPayee FSP cannot provide quote due to internal business rule validation failure or system error.For example, invalid account status of Payee, wrong fee configuration or database error\nCancel the transaction\n\n\n17\nTimeout\nPerform Transfer request timed out\nQuery transaction status and decide to complete or retryThe retry policy will be defined by the scheme rules.

The merchant initiates a request to pay transaction to the customer. The customer can review the transaction details and approve or reject the transaction on their mobile device.\nThus, it is a two-step business process in which the merchant initiates a payment transaction and the customer authorizes the transaction from their account.\n4.7.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayee-Initiated Transaction\n4.7.3 Actors and roles\nThe actors and roles for Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment are described in Table 14.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction Pattern\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nPayer\nAn individual End User of one FSP who buys goods or service from a merchant of another FSP.\n\n\nMerchant\nPayee\nThe business who sells goods or provides services and then receives payment from the customer.\n\n\n\nTable 14 – Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment: Actors and Roles\n4.7.4 Addition to General Pattern\nThis section describes how the use case connects to the general pattern.

This device has the capability to capture the customer’s authorization on POS instead of the customer’s mobile device. The authorization information captured in POS should be sent to Payer FSP to perform the authorization.\nThe business process involves two parties, Merchant and Customer. The merchant initiates a request to pay for the customer, and the customer reviews the payment request on POS and authorizes the payment by OTP or QR code on the POS itself. The customer authentication information is sent from Payee FSP to Payer FSP for authentication by Payer FSP. If authentication is successful then transaction will be posted on Payer FSP and Payee FSP.\n4.8.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayee-Initiated Transaction using OTP\n4.8.3 Actors and roles\nThe actors and roles for Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment Authorized on POS are described in Table 16.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction\nPattern Description\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nPayer\nAn individual End User of one FSP who buys goods or service from a merchant of another FSP.\n\n\nMerchant\nPayee\nThe business who sells goods or provide service and then receive payment from the customer.\n\n\n\nTable 16 – Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment Authorized on POS: Actors and Roles\n4.8.4 Addition to General Pattern\nThis section describes how the use case connects to the general pattern. The description is focused on the end-user, because the interactions between the participating systems are described in the general pattern.\n4.8.4.1 Step 1-3\nThe customer can pre-authorize the transaction by generating a dynamic payment QR code on a mobile app if they have a smart phone.\nThe customer can request an OTP on the USSD menu if they have a feature phone.\n4.8.4.2 Step 4\nFor mobile app:\n\nThe merchant uses a scan device such as a POS to capture the QR code and initiate the payment.\n\nBoth customer ID and OTP are encoded in the QR code.\n\n\nFor feature phone:\n\nThe merchant inputs customer’s ID and amount to initiate the transaction.\n\n4.8.4.3 Step 20\nSteps 1-3 are optional and will be used only when OTP is generated by Payer to authenticate the purchase at the merchant\ndevice. However, it would be very rare for a customer to generate the OTP manually; instead Payer FSP would generate an OTP for the customer as described in Step 20.\n4.8.4.4 Step 21\nThere is a risk that someone other than the owner of phone may attempt to use the phone to make a transaction at agent store. Thus, the transaction should be approved via PIN to allow OTP to be generated automatically.\n4.8.4.5 Step 25\nThe customer need only confirm the transaction on POS if initiating transaction with a QR code in step 4, because OTP is encoded in the QR code and parsed in Step 4.\n4.8.4.6 Step 36\nA notification is sent to the merchant once the transaction is performed by the Payee FSP.

ATM initiates a Cash-Out request from the customer account and the customer confirms the request by providing authentication (OTP) on ATM. The customer pre-generates an OTP for cash-out and uses this OTP on ATM device to initiate ATM Cash-out. The Payer FSP validates the OTP received in ATM-Initiated Cash-Out request for the validity of OTP as well as for authentication. If the customer authentication via OTP is successful; then the customer’s account will be debited at Payer FSP and ATM account maintained at Payee FSP will be credited. As a result, the customer receives cash from ATM.\n4.9.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayee-Initiated Transaction using OTP\n4.9.3 Actors and roles\nThe actors and roles for ATM Initiated Cash Out are described in Table 18.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction\nPattern Description\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nPayer\nPayer is a customer who wants to withdraw cash from ATM device belonging to another FSP.\n\n\nATM Provider\nPayee\nPayee is an ATM provider who provides cash withdrawal service on ATM device to a customer belonging to another FSP. ATM would be connected to a bank network which is connected to Payee FSP. There would be a pre-funded account in Payee FSP corresponding to an ATM or ATMs, or to a Bank Switch.\n\n\n\nTable 18 – ATM-Initiated Cash-Out: Actors and Roles\n4.9.4 Addition to General Pattern\nThis section describes how the use case connects to the general pattern. The description is focused on the end-user as the interactions between the participating systems are described in the general pattern.\n4.9.4.1 Step 1-3\nSteps 1 to 3 are optional; however, it is recommended that customer generate an OTP before initiating the transaction request from ATM.\nAlternatively, a customer generates a QR code for cash-out via mobile app other than OTP.\n4.9.4.2 Step 4\nFor mobile app:\n\nATM can scan previously-generated cash-out QR code.\n\nFor feature phone:\n\nThe customer initiates withdrawal transaction by inputting their account ID and amount.\n\n4.9.4.3 Step 20\nIn ATM-Initiated Cash-Out, it is very rare that an OTP is automatically generated by a Payer FSP, because this will delay the transaction due to SMS delivery, and the ATM transaction will time out. Therefore, it is recommended that customer generate an OTP for ATM Cash-out as mentioned in Steps 1-3.\n4.9.4.4 Step 21\nThere is a risk that someone other than the owner of phone holding the handset may make a transaction at an ATM device. In this case, the transaction should be approved via PIN so that the OTP can be generated automatically.\n4.9.4.5 Step 25\nIf an OTP is used, the customer enters the OTP that was generated in Steps 1-3 or Step 21.\nIf a QR code is used to cash-out and it is captured by an ATM when initiating the transaction in Step 4, then the customer must confirm or reject the transaction on the ATM only; inputting security credentials such as OTP or password is not necessary.\n4.9.5 Relevant Error Conditions\nTable 19 describes relevant errors and recommended follow-up actions for this use case.\n\n\n\nStep\nError Condition\nError Description\nFollow Up Action\n\n\n\n\n5\nTimeout\nLookup Party Information request timed out\nRetry\n\n\n6\nCustomer cannot be found\nAccount Lookup System fails to locate the customer\nCancel the transaction\n\n\n8\nTransaction request timeout\nPerform Transaction Request timed out at Switch or Payee FSP\nQuery and retry\n\n\n14\nQuote request timeout\nCalculate Quote request timed out\nRetry\n\n\n15\nQuote request failed\nCalculate Quote request fails at Switch or Payee FSP\nCancel the transaction\n\n\n33\nTransfer request timeout\nPerform Transfer request timed out\nQuery transaction status and decide to complete or retryThe retry policy will be defined by the scheme rules.

The use case is written from the end-user perspective to give additional information to the Generic Transaction Patterns document.\nBulk Payments are used when an organization or business is paying out funds; for example, aid or salary to multiple Payees. The organization or business can group transactions together to make it easier to upload and validate individual transactions in bulk before the bulk transaction is executed. It is also possible for the organization to follow up the result of the individual transactions in the bulk transaction after the bulk transaction is executed.\n4.10.2 Reference to Generic Pattern\nBulk Transactions\n4.10.3 Actors and roles\nThe actors and roles for Bulk Payments are described in Table 20.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction\nPattern Description\n\n\n\n\nPayer\nPayer\nThe Payer is a corporate, government or aid organization that is transferring money from its own account to multiple Payees. The reason can for instance be payout of monthly salary or aid disbursement.The Payer is a registered user with an account in the Payer FSP.\n\n\nPayee\nPayee\nThe Payee is, for example, an employee at a corporate or receiver of aid that is receiving a payout from the Payer.The Payee is a registered user with an account in one of the connected FSPs.\n\n\n\nTable 20 – Bulk Payments: Actors and Roles\n4.10.4 Addition to General Pattern\nThis section describes how the use case connects to the general pattern. The description is focused on the end-user as the interactions between the participating systems are described in the general pattern.\n4.10.4.1 Step 1\nThe Payer creates a bulk transaction according to the format of the Payer FSP. Each row in the bulk transaction includes information about a transfer between a Payer account and a Payee account. The information includes:\n\nA unique transaction ID for the bulk so that the Payer can follow up the status of individual transactions in the bulk.\n\nIdentifier of the Payee\n\nAmount and currency to be transferred\n\n\nThe Payer will upload the bulk transaction using the interface provided by the Payer FSP.\n4.10.4.2 Step 12\nThe Payer is notified by the Payer FSP that the bulk is ready for review.\nThe Payer will get a bulk transaction report and validate that the specified Payees have accounts and can receive funds.\nThe Payer can also validate any fees that will be charged for executing the bulk transaction. Fees will be calculated per transaction in the bulk transaction.\nBefore the bulk transaction is executed, the Payer must ensure that there are enough funds in the Payer account for the value of the complete bulk transaction to be completed. Depending on scheme rules the Payer FSP needs to ensure that there are enough funds prefunded to the Payee FSP to be able to complete the transactions to the Payee.\nIf the Payer is satisfied after reviewing the bulk transaction, then the Payer will initiate the execution of the bulk transaction.\nIf the Payer does not want to execute the bulk transaction, then the bulk transaction can be canceled. Cancellation will be\nhandled internally in the Payer FSP. No information regarding cancelation will be sent to the Payee FSP.\nHow execution and cancelation is handled depends on the implementation in the Payer FSP.\n4.10.4.3 Step 21\nThe Payer can review the result of the bulk transaction execution when the Payer FSP has processed all the transactions in the uploaded bulk transaction.\nThe Payer will be able to get details about the execution for each individual transaction.\nAny reprocessing that might be needed to be executed (for example, failed transactions) will be treated as a new bulk transaction in the API.\n4.10.5 Relevant Error Conditions\nBulk Transactions have two main types of logical errors: Errors connected to the header and errors related to the transactions in the bulk transaction.\nAn error related to the header will fail the complete bulk transaction. For example, if the Payer of the bulk transaction is blocked, then no transaction shall be executed.\nErrors related to an individual transaction within the bulk transaction will get a failed status and be assigned an error code. The amount of the transaction that failed will be rolled back. Other transactions in the bulk transaction will not be affected if one individual transaction fails.\nTable 21 contains a description of general error cases to give an overview of the bulk transaction use case and how different error cases are handled. Detailed error codes for the operations are not included, nor are codes for communication errors and format validations errors.\n\n\n\nStep\nError Condition\nError Description\nFollow Up Action\n\n\n\n\n5\nPayee not found\nAccount lookup fails to look up Payee at any FSP.\nPayee will be excluded from  any bulk transactions request and marked as failed in the bulk transaction response to the Payer\n\n\n8\nPayee not found\nPayee FSP cannot find the Payee account\nPayee FSP will mark the individual transaction in the bulk transaction as failed.\n\n\n15\nNot enough funds on Payer FSP account\nThe Payer FSP account in the\nSwitch has not been prefunded to cover for the complete bulk transaction.

This could, for example, be blocked due to an account limit.\nThe individual transaction will be rolled back and reported in Payer response as failed.\n\n\n16\nBulk quote expired\nThe quote for the bulk transaction has expired\nThe Payee FSP will fail the complete bulk transaction requests.\n\n\n\nTable 21 – Bulk Payments: Relevant Error Conditions\n4.11 Refund\nThis section describes how to refund a completed interoperability transaction.\nThere are several refund scenarios for merchant payment transaction:\n\nThe customer has entered an amount incorrectly and paid more than the invoice.\n\nThe merchant is not able to deliver the goods as specified by the invoice already paid by the customer, so the merchant wants to refund money to the customer.\n\nAn online merchant selling tickets (train, air or bus) provides a refund to a customer when the customer cancels the ticket.\n\nThe customer has returned the goods to the merchant and the merchant wants to refund the customer. \n\n\nAdditional business scenarios may require transaction reversals. For example:\n\nThe customer has sent money to incorrect recipient.\n\nThe customer accidently created the same transaction twice.\n\n\nIt is recommended to use refund transaction to fulfill the business purpose.\nThe business process will remain as reversal, but the technical implementation would require Payee FSP CCE to initiate a refund transaction. Payer FSP CCE coordinates with Payee CCE manually. If there is a Switch, then Switch administrator may help to facilitate the conversation between Payer FSP and Payee FSP.\nNote the following:\n\nRefund can only be initiated by Payee of the original transaction. Alternatively, CCE of Payee FSP in the original transaction can also initiate refund from Payee account.\n\nAn original transaction can be refunded multiple times.\n\n\n4.11.1 Reference to Generic Pattern\nPayer-Initiated Transaction\n4.11.2 Actors and roles\nThe actors and roles for Bulk Payment are described in Table 22.\n\n\n\nRole\nMap to Generic Transaction\nPattern Description\n\n\n\n\nPayee\nPayee\nThe End User who has made a wrong payment and requests a refund.\n\n\nPayer\nPayer\nThe End User who has received the payment in the original transaction.\n\n\n\nTable 22 – Refund: Actors and Roles\n4.11.3 Addition to General Pattern\nThis section describes how the use case connects to the general pattern.

Introduction\nThis document introduces and describes the Open API (Application Programming Interface) for FSP (Financial Service Provider) Interoperability (hereafter cited as \"the API\"). The purpose of the API is to enable interoperable financial transactions between a Payer (a payer of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in one FSP (an entity that provides a digital financial service to an end user) and a Payee (a recipient of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in another FSP. The API does not specify any front-end services between a Payer or Payee and its own FSP; all services defined in the API are between FSPs. FSPs are connected either (a) directly to each other or (b) by a Switch placed between the FSPs to route financial transactions to the correct FSP.\nThe transfer of funds from a Payer to a Payee should be performed in near real-time. As soon as a financial transaction has been agreed to by both parties, it is deemed irrevocable. This means that a completed transaction cannot be reversed in the API. To reverse a transaction, a new negated refund transaction should be created from the Payee of the original transaction.\nThe API is designed to be sufficiently generic to support both a wide number of use cases and extensibility of those use cases, However, it should contain sufficient detail to enable implementation in an unambiguous fashion.\nVersion 1.0 of the API is designed to be used within a country or region, international remittance that requires foreign exchange is not supported. This version also contains basic support for the Interledger Protocol, which will in future versions of the API be used for supporting foreign exchange and multi-hop financial transactions.\nThis document:\n\nDefines an asynchronous REST binding of the logical API introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nAdds to and builds on the information provided in Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification. The contents of the Specification are listed in Section 2.1.\n\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\nUse Cases\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\nJSON Binding Rules\nScheme Rules\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\nSignature\nEncryption\n\n3. API Definition\nThis section introduces the technology used by the API, including:\n\nGeneral Characteristics\nHTTP Details\nAPI Versioning\n\n3.1 General Characteristics\nThis section describes the general characteristics of the API.\n3.1.1 Architectural Style\nThe API is based on the REST (REpresentational State Transfer1) architectural style. There are, however, some differences between a typical REST implementation and this one. These differences include:\n\nFully asynchronous API -- To be able to handle numerous concurrent long-running processes and to have a single mechanism for handling requests, all API services are asynchronous. Examples of long-running processes are:\n\nFinancial transactions done in bulk\nA financial transaction in which user interaction is needed\n\n\nDecentralized -- Services are decentralized, there is no central authority which drives a transaction.\n\nService-oriented -- The resources provided by the API are relatively service-oriented compared to a typical implementation of a REST-based API.\n\nNot fully stateless -- Some state information must be kept in both client and server during the process of performing a financial transaction.\n\nClient decides common ID -- In a typical REST implementation, in which there is a clear distinction between client and server, it is the server that generates the ID of an object when the object is created on the server. In this API, a quote or a financial transaction resides both in the Payer and Payee FSP as the services are decentralized. Therefore, there is a need for a common ID of the object. The reason for having the client decide the common ID is two-fold:\n\nThe common ID is used in the URI of the asynchronous callback to the client. The client therefore knows which URI to listen to for a callback regarding the request.\nThe client can use the common ID in an HTTP GET request directly if it does not receive a callback from the server (see Section 3.2.2 for more information).\n\nTo keep the common IDs unique, each common ID is defined as a UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier2 (UUID). To further guarantee uniqueness, it is recommended that a server should separate each client FSP's IDs by mapping the FSP ID and the object ID together. If a server still receives a non-unique common ID during an HTTP POST request (see Section 3.2.2 for more details). The request should be handled as detailed in Section 3.2.5.\n\n\n3.1.2 Application-Level Protocol\nHTTP, as defined in RFC 72303, is used as the application-level protocol in the API. All communication in production environments should be secured using HTTPS (HTTP over TLS4). For more details about the use of HTTP in the API, see Section 3.2.\n3.1.3 URI Syntax\nThe syntax of URIs follows RFC 39865 to identify resources and services provided by the API. This section introduces and notes implementation subjects specific to each syntax part.\nA generic URI has the form shown in Listing 1, where the part [user:password@]host[:port] is the Authority part described in Section 3.1.3.2\n{resource}.\nListing 1\nscheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]\n\nListing 1 -- Generic URI format\n3.1.3.1 Scheme\nIn accordance with Section 3.1.2, the scheme (that is, the set of rules, practices and standards necessary for the functioning of payment services) will always be either http or https.\n3.1.3.2 Authority\nThe authority part consists of an optional authentication (User Information) part, a mandatory host part, followed by an optional port number.\n3.1.3.2.1 User Information\nUser information should in general not be used by API deployments; the security measures detailed in API Signature and API Encryption should be used instead.\n3.1.3.2.2 Host\nThe host is the server's address. It can be either an IP address or a hostname. The host will (usually) differ for each deployment.\n3.1.3.2.3 Port\nThe port number is optional; by default, the HTTP port is 80 and HTTPS is 443, but other ports could also be used. Which port to use might differ from deployment to deployment.\n3.1.3.3 Path\nThe path points to an actual API resource or service. The resources in the API are:\n\nparticipants\nparties\nquotes\ntransactionRequests\nauthorizations\ntransfers\ntransactions\nbulkQuotes\nbulkTransfers\n\nAll resources found above are also organized further in a hierarchical form, separated by one or more forward slashes ('/'). Resources support different services depending on the HTTP method used. All supported API resources and services, tabulated with URI and HTTP method, appear in Table 5.\n3.1.3.4 Query\nThe query is an optional part of a URI; it is currently only used and supported by a few services in the API. See the API resources in Section 6, API Services, for more details about which services support query strings. All other services should ignore the query string part of the URI, as query strings may be added in future minor versions of the API (see Section 3.3.2).\nIf more than one key-value pair is used in the query string, the pairs should be separated by an ampersand symbol ('&').\nListing 2 shows a URI example from the API resource /authorization, in which four different key-value pairs are present in the query string, separated by an ampersand symbol.\nListing 2\n/authorization/3d492671-b7af-4f3f-88de-76169b1bdf88?authenticationType=OTP&retriesLeft=2&amount=102&currency=USD\n\nListing 2 -- Example URI containing several key-value pairs in the query string\n3.1.3.5 Fragment\nThe fragment is an optional part of a URI. It is not supported for use by any service in the API and therefore should be ignored if received.\n3.1.4 URI Normalization and Comparison\nAs specified in RFC 72306, the scheme (Section 3.1.3.1) and host (Section 3.1.3.2.2) part of the URI should be considered case-insensitive. All other parts of the URI should be processed in a case-sensitive manner.\n3.1.5 Character Set\nThe character set should always be assumed to be UTF-8, defined in 36297; therefore, it does not need to be sent in any of the HTTP header fields (see Section 3.2.1). No character set other than UTF-8 is supported by the API.\n3.1.6 Data Exchange Format\nThe API uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), defined in RFC 71598, as its data exchange format. JSON is an open, lightweight, human-readable and platform-independent format, well-suited for interchanging data between systems.\n3.2 HTTP Details\nThis section contains detailed information regarding the use of the application-level protocol HTTP in the API.\n3.2.1 HTTP Header Fields\nHTTP Headers are generally described in RFC 72309. The following two sections describes the HTTP header fields that should be expected and implemented in the API.\nThe API supports a maximum size of 65536 bytes (64 Kilobytes) in the HTTP header.\n3.2.1.1 HTTP Request Header Fields\nTable 1 contains the HTTP request header fields that must be supported by implementers of the API. An implementation should also expect other standard and non-standard HTTP request header fields not listed here.\nTable 1\n\n\n\nField\nExample Values\nCardinality\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAccept\napplication/vnd.interoperability.resource+json\n0..1Mandatory in a request from a client. Not used in a callback from the server.The Accept10 header field indicates the version of the API the client would like the server to use. See HTTP Accept Header Section 3.3.4.1 for more information on requesting a specific version of the API.\n\n\nContent-Length\n3495\n0..1\nThe Content-Type11 header field indicates the anticipated size of the payload body. Only sent if there is a body.>Note: The API supports a maximum size of 5242880 bytes (5 Megabytes).\n\n\nContent-Type\napplication/vnd.interoperability.resource+json;version=1.0\n1\nThe Content-Type12 header indicates the specific version of the API used to send the payload body. See Section 3.3.4.2 for more information.\n\n\nDate\nTue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT\n1\nThe Date13 header field indicates the date when the request was sent.\n\n\nX- Forwarded- For\nX-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.4, 136.225.27.13\n1..0\nThe X-Forwarded-For14 header field is an unofficially accepted standard used to indicate the originating client IP address for informational purposes, as a request might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so on. Multiple X-Forwarded-For values as in the example shown here should be expected and supported by implementers of the API.Note: An alternative to X-Forwarded-For is defined in RFC 723915. However, as of 2018, RFC 7239 is less-used and supported than X-Forwarded-For.\n\n\nFSPIOP- Source\nFSP321\n1\nThe FSPIOP-Source header field is a non- HTTP standard field used by the API for identifying the sender of the HTTP request. The field should be set by the original sender of the request. Required for routing (see Section 3.2.3.5) and signature verification (see header field FSPIOP-Signature).\n\n\nFSPIOP- Destination\nFSP123\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-Destination header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for HTTP header-based routing of requests and responses to the destination. The field should be set by the original sender of the request (if known), so that any entities between the client and the server do not need to parse the payload for routing purposes (see Section 3.2.3.5).\n\n\nFSPIOP- Encryption\n\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-Encryption header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for applying end-to-end encryption of the request.For more information, see API Encryption.\n\n\nFSPIOP- Signature\n\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-Signature header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for applying an end-to-end request signature.For more information, see API Signature.\n\n\nFSPIOP-URI\n/parties/msisdn/123456789\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-URI header field is a non- HTTP standard field used by the API for signature verification, should contain the service URI. Required if signature verification is used, for more information see API Signature.\n\n\nFSPIOP- HTTP- Method\nGET\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-HTTP-Method header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for signature verification, should contain the service HTTP method. Required if signature verification is used, for more information see API Signature.\n\n\n\nTable 1 -- HTTP request header fields\n3.2.1.2 HTTP Response Header Fields\nTable 2 contains the HTTP response header fields that must be supported by implementers of the API. An implementation should also expect other standard and non-standard HTTP response header fields that are not listed here.\nTable 2\n\n\n\nField\nExample Values\nCardinality\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nContent-Lenght\n3495\n0..1\nThe Content-Length16 header field indicates the anticipated size of the payload body. Only sent if there is a body.\n\n\nContent-Type\napplication/vnd.interoperability.resource+json;version=1.0\n1\nThe Content-Type17 header field indicates the specific version of the API used to send the payload body. See Section 3.3.4.2 for more information.\n\n\n\nTable 2 -- HTTP response header fields\n3.2.2 HTTP Methods\nThe following HTTP methods, as defined in RFC 723118, are supported by the API:\n\nGET -- The HTTP GET method is used from a client to request information about a previously-created object on a server. As all services in the API are asynchronous, the response to the GET method will not contain the requested object. The requested object will instead come as part of a callback using the HTTP PUT method.\n\nPUT -- The HTTP PUT method is used as a callback to a previously sent HTTP GET, HTTP POST or HTTP DELETE method, sent from a server to its client. The callback will contain either:\n\nObject information concerning a previously created object (HTTP POST) or sent information request (HTTP GET).\nAcknowledgement that whether an object was deleted (HTTP DELETE).\nError information in case the HTTP POST or HTTP GET request failed to be processed on the server.\n\n\nPOST -- The HTTP POST method is used from a client to request an object to be created on the server. As all services in the API are asynchronous, the response to the POST method will not contain the created object. The created object will instead come as part of a callback using the HTTP PUT method.\n\nDELETE -- The HTTP DELETE method is used from a client to request an object to be deleted on the server. The HTTP DELETE method should only be supported in a common Account Lookup System (ALS) for deleting information regarding a previously added Party (an account holder in a FSP), no other object types can be deleted. As all services in the API are asynchronous, the response to the HTTP DELETE method will not contain the final acknowledgement that the object was deleted or not; the final acknowledgement will come as a callback using the HTTP PUT method.\n\n\n3.2.3 HTTP Sequence Flow\nAll the sequences and related services use an asynchronous call flow. No service supports a synchronous call flow.\n3.2.3.1 HTTP POST Call Flow\nFigure 1 shows the normal API call flow for a request to create an object in a Peer FSP using HTTP POST. The service /service in the flow should be renamed to any of the services in Table 5 that support the HTTP POST method.\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1 -- HTTP POST call flow\n3.2.3.2 HTTP GET Call Flow\nFigure 2 shows the normal API call flow for a request to get information about an object in a Peer FSP using HTTP GET. The service /service/{ID} in the flow should be renamed to any of the services in Table 5 that supports the HTTP GET method.\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2 -- HTTP GET call flow\n3.2.3.3 HTTP DELETE Call Flow\nFigure 3 contains the normal API call flow to delete FSP information about a Party in an ALS using HTTP DELETE. The service /service/{ID} in the flow should be renamed to any of the services in Table 5 that supports the HTTP DELETE method. HTTP DELETE is only supported in a common ALS, which is why the figure shows the ALS entity as a server only.\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3 -- HTTP DELETE call flow\nNote: It is also possible that requests to the ALS be routed through a Switch, or that the ALS and the Switch are the same server.\n3.2.3.4 HTTP PUT Call Flow\nThe HTTP PUT is always used as a callback to either a POST service request, a GET service request, or a DELETE service request.\nThe call flow of a PUT request and response can be seen in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3.\n3.2.3.5 Call Flow Routing using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source\nThe non-standard HTTP header fields FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are used for routing and message signature verification purposes (see API Signature for more information regarding signature verification). Figure 4 shows how the header fields are used for routing in an abstract POST /service call flow, where the destination (Peer) FSP is known.\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 4 -- Using the customized HTTP header fields FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source\nFor some services when a Switch is used, the destination FSP might be unknown. An example of this scenario is when an FSP sends a GET /parties to the Switch without knowing which Peer FSP that owns the Party (see Section 6.3.1 describing the scenario). FSPIOP-Destination will in that case be empty (or set to the Switch's ID) from the FSP, but will subsequently be set by the Switch to the correct Peer FSP. See Figure 5 for an example describing the usage of FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source.\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 5 -- Example scenario where FSPIOP-Destination is unknown by FSP\n3.2.4 HTTP Response Status Codes\nThe API supports the HTTP response status codes19 in Table 3.\nTable 3\n\n\n\nStatus Code\nReason\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n200\nOK\nStandard response for a successful request. Used in the API by the client as a response on a callback to mark the completion of an asynchronous service.\n\n\n202\nAccepted\nThe request has been accepted for future processing at the server, but the server cannot guarantee that the outcome of the request will be successful. Used in the API to acknowledge that the server has received an asynchronous request.\n\n\n400\nBad Request\nThe application cannot process the request; for example, due to malformed syntax or the payload exceeded size restrictions.\n\n\n401\nUnauthorized\nThe request requires authentication in order to be processed.\n\n\n403\nForbidden\nThe request was denied and will be denied in the future.\n\n\n404\nNot Found\nThe resource specified in the URI was not found.\n\n\n405\nMethod Not Allowed\nAn unsupported HTTP method for the request was used; see Table 5 for information on which HTTP methods are allowed in which services.\n\n\n406\nNot acceptable\nThe server is not capable of generating content according to the Accept headers sent in the request. Used in the API to indicate that the server does not support the version that the client is requesting.\n\n\n501\nNot Implemented\nThe server does not support the requested service. The client should not retry.\n\n\n503\nService Unavailable\nThe server is currently unavailable to accept any new service requests. This should be a temporary state, and the client should retry within a reasonable time frame.\n\n\n\n Table 3 -- HTTP response status codes supported in the API\nAny HTTP status codes 3xx20 returned by the server should not be retried and require manual investigation.\nAn implementation of the API should also be capable of handling other errors not defined above as the request could potentially be routed through proxy servers.\nAs all requests in the API are asynchronous, additional HTTP error codes for server errors (error codes starting with 5xx21 that are not defined in Table 3) are not used by the API itself. Any error on the server during actual processing of a request will be sent as part of an error callback to the client (see Section 9.2).\n3.2.4.1 Error Information in HTTP Response\nIn addition to the HTTP response code, all HTTP error responses (4xx and 5xx status codes) can optionally contain an ErrorInformation element, defined in Section 7.4.2 This element should be used to give more detailed information to the client if possible.\n3.2.5 Idempotent Services in Server\nAll services that support HTTP GET must be idempotent; that is, the same request can be sent from a client any number of times without changing the object on the server. The server is allowed to change the state of the object; for example, a transaction state can be changed, but the FSP sending the GET request cannot change the state.\nAll services that support HTTP POST must be idempotent in case the client is sending the same service ID again; that is, the server must not create a new service object if a client sends the same POST request again. The reason behind this is to simplify the handling of resends during error-handling in a client; however, this creates some extra requirements of the server that receives the request. An example in which the same POST request is sent several times can be seen in Section 9.4.\n3.2.5.1 Duplicate Analysis in Server on Receiving a HTTP POST Request\nWhen a server receives a request from a client, the server should check to determine if there is an already-existing service object with the same ID; for example, if a client has previously sent the request POST /transfers with the identical transferId. If the object already exists, the server must check to determine if the parameters of the already-created object match the parameters from the new request.\n\nIf the previously-created object matches the parameter from the new request, the request should be assumed to be a resend from the client.\n\nIf the server has not finished processing the old request and therefore has not yet sent the callback to the client, this new request can be ignored, because a callback is about to be sent to the client.\nIf the server has finished processing the old request and a callback has already been sent, a new callback should be sent to the client, similar to if a HTTP GET request had been sent.\n\n\nIf the previously-created object does not match the parameters from the new request, an error callback should be sent to the client explaining that an object with the provided ID already exists with conflicting parameters.\n\n\nTo simplify duplicate analysis, it is recommended to create and store a hash value of all incoming POST requests on the server, so that it is easy to compare the hash value against later incoming POST requests.\n3.3 API Versioning\nThe strategy of the development of the API is to maintain backwards compatibility between the API and its resources and services to the maximum extent possible; however, changes to the API should be expected by implementing parties. Versioning of the API is specific to the API resource (for example, /participants, /quotes, /transfers).\nThere are two types of API resource versions: Minor versions, which are backwards-compatible, and major versions, which are backwards-incompatible.\n\nWhenever a change in this document defining the characteristics of the API is updated that in some way affects an API service, the affected resource will be updated to a new major or minor version (depending on whether the changes are backwards-compatible or not).\n\nWhenever a change is made to a specific service in the API, a new version of the corresponding resource will be released.\n\n\nThe format of the resource version is x.y where x is the major version and y is the minor version. Both major and minor versions are sequentially numbered. When a new major version of a service is released, the minor version is reset to 0. The initial version of each resource in the API is 1.0.\n3.3.1 Changes not Affecting the API Resource Version\nSome changes will not affect the API resource version; for example, if the order of parameters within a request or callback were to be changed.\n3.3.2 Minor API Resource Version\nThe following list describes the changes that are considered backwards compatible if the change affects any API service connected to a resource. API implementers should implement their client/server in such a way that the API services automatically support these changes without breaking any functionality.\n\nOptional input parameters such as query strings added in a request\nOptional parameters added in a request or a callback\nError codes added\n\nThese types of changes affect the minor API service version.\n3.3.3 Major API Resource Versions\nThe following list describes the changes that are considered backwards-incompatible if the change affects any API service connected to a resource. API implementers do not need to implement their client/server in such a way that it automatically supports these changes.\n\nMandatory parameters removed or added to a request or callback\nOptional parameters changed to mandatory in a request or callback\nParameters renamed\nData types changed\nBusiness logic of API resource or connected services changed\nAPI resource/service URIs changed\n\nThese types of changes affect the major API service version. Please note that the list is not comprehensive; there might be other changes as well that could affect the major API service version.\n3.3.4 Version Negotiation between Client and Server\nThe API supports basic version negotiation by using HTTP content negotiation between the server and the client. A client should send the API resource version that it would like to use in the Accept header to the server (see Section 3.3.4.1). If the server supports that version, it should use that version in the callback (see Section 3.3.4.2). If the server does not support the requested version, the server should reply with HTTP status 40622 including a list of supported versions (see Section 3.3.4.3).\n3.3.4.1 HTTP Accept Header\nSee below for an example of a simplified HTTP request which only includes an Accept header23. The Accept header should be used from a client requesting a service from a server specifying a major version of the API service. The example in Listing 3 should be interpreted as \"I would like to use major version 1 of the API resource, but if that version is not supported by the server then give me the latest supported version\".\nListing 3\nPOST /service HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/vnd.interoperability.{resource}+json;version=1,\napplication/vnd.interoperability.{resource}+json\n\n{\n    ...\n}\nListing 3 -- HTTP Accept header example, requesting version 1 or the latest supported version\nRegarding the example in Listing 3:\n\nThe POST /service should be changed to any HTTP method and related service or resource that is supported by the API (see Table 5).\nThe Accept header field is used to indicate the API resource version the client would like to use. If several versions are supported by the client, more than one version can be requested separated by a comma (,) as in the example above.\nThe application type is always application/vnd.interoperability.{resource}, where {resource} is the actual resource (for example, participants or quotes).\nThe only data exchange format currently supported is json.\nIf a client can use any minor version of a major version, only the major version should be sent; for example, version=1 or version=2.\nIf a client would like to use a specific minor version, this should be indicated by using the specific major.minor version; for example, version=1.2 or version=2.8. The use of a specific major.minor version in the request should generally be avoided, as minor versions should be backwards-compatible.\n\n\n\n3.3.4.2 Acceptable Version Requested by Client\nIf the server supports the API resource version requested by the client in the Accept Headers, it should use that version in the subsequent callback. The used major.minor version should always be indicated in the Content-Type header by the server, even if the client only requested a major version of the API. See the example in Listing 4, which indicates that version 1.0 is used by the server:\nListing 4\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.resource+json;version=1.0\nListing 4 -- Content-Type HTTP header field example\n3.3.4.3 Non-Acceptable Version Requested by Client\nIf the server does not support the version requested by the client in the Accept header, the server should reply with HTTP status 406, which indicates that the requested version is not supported.\nNote: There is also a possibility that the information might be sent as part of an error callback to a client instead of directly in the response; for example, when the request is routed through a Switch which does support the requested version, but the destination FSP does not support the requested version.\nAlong with HTTP status 406, the supported versions should be listed as part of the error message in the extensions list, using the major version number as key and minor version number as value. Please see error information in the example in Listing 5, describing the server's supported versions. The example should be interpreted as \"I do not support the resource version that you requested, but I do support versions 1.0, 2.1, and 4.2\".\nListing 5\n{\n    \"errorInformation\": {\n        \"errorCode\": \"3001\",\n        \"errorDescription\": \"The Client requested an unsupported version, see exten-\nsion list for supported version(s).\",\n        \"extensionList\": [\n            { \"key\": \"1\", \"value\": \"0\"},\n            { \"key\": \"2\", \"value\": \"1\"},\n            { \"key\": \"4\", \"value\": \"2\"},\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nListing 5 -- Example error message when server does not support the requested version\n1  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm -- Representational State Transfer (REST)\n2  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122 -- A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace\n3  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing\n4  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246 -- The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol - Version 1.2\n5  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 -- Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax\n6  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing - http and https URI Normalization and Comparison\n7  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629 -- UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646\n8  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159 -- The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format\n9  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing - Header Fields\n10  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Accept\n11  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing -- Content-Length\n12  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -- Content-Type\n13  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -- Date\n14  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For -- X-Forwarded-For\n15  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239 -- Forwarded HTTP Extension\n16  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing -- Content-Length\n17  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -- Content-Type\n18  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Request Methods\n19  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Response Status Codes\n20  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Redirection 3xx\n21  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Server Error 5xx\n22  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.6 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - 406 Not Acceptable\n23  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Accept\n4. Interledger Protocol\nThe current version of the API includes basic support for the Interledger Protocol (ILP), by defining a concrete implementation of the Interledger Payment Request protocol24 in API Resource /quotes, Section 6.5, and API Resource /transfers, Section 6.7.\n4.1 More Information\nThis document contains ILP information that is relevant to the API. For more information about the ILP protocol, see the Interledger project website25, the Interledger Whitepaper26, and the Interledger architecture specification27.\n4.2 Introduction to Interledger\nILP is a standard for internetworking payment networks. In the same way that the Internet Protocol (IP) establishes a set of basic standards for the transmission and addressing of data packets between different data networks, ILP establishes a set of basic standards for the addressing of financial transactions and transfer of value between accounts on different payment networks.\nILP is not a scheme. It is a set of standards that, if implemented by multiple payment schemes, will allow those schemes to be interoperable. Therefore, implementing ILP involves adapting an existing scheme to conform to those standards. Conformance means ensuring that transfers between accounts within the scheme are done in two phases (reserve and commit) and defining a mapping between the accounts in the scheme and the global ILP Addressing scheme. This can be done by modifying the scheme itself, or by the entities that provide ILP-conformant access to the scheme using scheme adaptors.\nThe basic prerequisites for an ILP payment are the Payee ILP address(see Section 4.3) and the condition (see Section 4.4). In the current version of the API, both these prerequisites should be returned by the Payee FSP during quoting API Resource /quotes, see Section 6.5) of the financial transaction.\n4.3 ILP Addressing\nA key component of the ILP standard is the ILP addressing28 scheme. It is a hierarchical scheme that defines one or more addresses for every account on a ledger.\nTable 4 shows some examples of ILP addresses that could be used in different scenarios, for different accounts. Note that while the structure of addresses is standardized, the content is not, except for the first segment (up to the first period (.)).\nTable 4\n\n\n\nILP Address\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ng.tz.fsp1.msisdn.1234567890\nA mobile money account at FSP1 for the user with MSISDN 1234567890.\n\n\ng.pk.fsp2.ac03396c-4dba-4743\nA mobile money account at FSP2 identified by an opaque account id.\n\n\ng.us.bank1.bob\nA bank account at Bank1 for the user bob.\n\n\n\nTable 4 -- ILP address examples\nThe primary purpose of an ILP addresses is to identify an account in order to route a financial transaction to that account.\nNote: An ILP address should not be used for identifying a counterparty in the Interoperability API. See Section 5.1.6.11 regarding how to address a Party in the API.\nIt is useful to think of ILP addresses as analogous to IP addresses. They are seldom, if ever, be seen by end users but are used by the systems involved in a financial transaction to identify an account and route the ILP payment. The design of the addressing scheme means that a single account will often have many ILP addresses. The system on which the account is maintained may track these or, if they are all derived from a common prefix, may track a subset only.\n4.4 Conditional Transfers\nILP depends on the concept of conditional transfers, in which all ledgers involved in a financial transaction from the Payer to the Payee can first reserve funds out of a Payer account and then later commit them to the Payee account. The transfer from the Payer to the Payee account is conditional on the presentation of a fulfilment that satisfies the condition attached to the original transfer request.\nTo support conditional transfers for ILP, a ledger must support a transfer API that attaches a condition and an expiry to the transfer. The ledger must prepare the transfer by reserving the funds from the Payer account, and then wait for one of the following events to occur:\n\nThe fulfilment of the condition is submitted to the ledger and the funds are committed to the Payee account.\n\nThe expiry timeout is reached, or the financial transaction is rejected by the Payee or Payee FSP. The transfer is then aborted and the funds that were reserved from the Payer account are returned.\n\n\nWhen the fulfilment of a transfer is submitted to a ledger, the ledger must ensure that the fulfilment is valid for the condition that was attached to the original transfer request. If it is valid, the transfer is committed, otherwise it is rejected, and the transfer remains in a pending state until a valid fulfilment is submitted or the transfer expires.\nILP supports a variety of conditions for performing a conditional payment, but implementers of the API should use the SHA-256 hash of a 32-byte pre-image. The condition attached to the transfer is the SHA-256 hash and the fulfilment of that condition is the pre-image. Therefore, if the condition attached to a transfer is a SHA -256 hash, then when a fulfilment is submitted for that transaction, the ledger will validate it by calculating the SHA-256 hash of the fulfilment and ensuring that the hash is equal to the condition.\nSee Section 6.5.1.2 Interledger Payment Request for concrete information on how to generate the fulfilment and the condition.\n4.5 ILP Packet\nThe ILP Packet is the mechanism used to package end-to-end data that can be passed in a hop-by-hop service. It is included as a field in hop-by-hop service calls and should not be modified by any intermediaries. The integrity of the ILP Packet is tightly bound to the integrity of the funds transfer, as the commit trigger (the fulfilment) is generated using a hash of the ILP Packet.\nThe packet has a strictly defined binary format, because it may be passed through systems that are designed for high performance and volume. These intermediary systems must read the ILP Address and the amount from the packet headers, but do not need to interpret the data field in the ILP Packet (see Listing 6). Since the intermediary systems should not need to interpret the data field, the format of the field is not strictly defined in the ILP Packet definition. It is simply defined as a variable length octet string. Section 6.5.1.2 Interledger Payment Request contains concrete information on how the ILP Packet is populated in the API.\nThe ILP Packet is the common thread that connects all the individual ledger transfers that make up an end-to-end ILP payment. The packet is parsed by the Payee of the first transfer and used to determine where to make the next transfer, and for how much. It is attached to that transfer and parsed by the Payee of the next transfer, who again determines where to make the next transfer, and for how much. This process is repeated until the Payee of the transfer is the Payee in the end-to-end financial transaction, who fulfils the condition, and the transfers are committed in sequence starting with the last and ending with the first.\nThe ILP Packet format is defined in ASN.129 (Abstract Syntax Notation One), shown in Listing 6. The packet is encoded using the canonical Octet Encoding Rules.\nListing 6\nInterledgerProtocolPaymentMessage ::= SEQUENCE {\n    -- Amount which must be received at the destination amount UInt64,\n    -- Destination ILP Address account Address,\n    -- Information for recipient (transport layer information) data OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..32767)),\n    -- Enable ASN.1 Extensibility\n    extensions SEQUENCE {\n        ...\n    }\n}\nListing 6 -- The ILP Packet format in ASN.1 format\nNote: The only mandatory data elements in the ILP Packet are the amount to be transferred to the account of the Payee and the ILP Address of the Payee.\n24  https://interledger.org/rfcs/0011-interledger-payment-request/ -- Interledger Payment Request (IPR)\n25  https://interledger.org/ -- Interledger\n26 https://interledger.org/interledger.pdf -- A Protocol for Interledger Payments\n27  https://interledger.org/rfcs/0001-interledger-architecture/ -- Interledger Architecture\n28  https://interledger.org/rfcs/0015-ilp-addresses/ -- ILP Addresses\n29  https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-X.696-201508-I!!PDF-E&type=items -- Information technology -- ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Octet Encoding Rules (OER)\n5. Common API Functionality\nThis section describes the common functionality used by the API, including:\n\nQuoting\nParty Addressing\nMapping of Use Cases to Transaction Types\n\n5.1 Quoting\nQuoting is the process that determines any fees and any commission required to perform a financial transaction between two FSPs. It is always initiated by the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP, which means that the quote flows in the same way as a financial transaction.\nTwo different modes for quoting between FSPs are supported in the API: Non-disclosing of fees and Disclosing of fees.\n\nNon-Disclosing of fees should be used when either the Payer FSP does not want to show the Payee FSP its fee structure, or when the Payer FSP would like to have more control of the fees paid by the Payer after quoting has been performed (the latter is only applicable for Receive amount; see next bullet list).\n\nDisclosing of fees can be used for use cases in which the Payee FSP wants to subsidize the transaction in some use cases; for  example, Cash-In at another FSP's agent.\n\n\nThe Non-Disclosing of fees mode should be the standard supported way of quoting in most schemes. Disclosing of fees might be used in some schemes; for example, a scheme in which a dynamic fee structure is used and a FSP wants the ability to subsidize the Cash-In use case based on the dynamic cost.\nIn addition, the Payer can decide if the amount should be Receive amount or Send amount.\n\nSend amount should be interpreted as the actual amount that should be deducted from the Payer's account, including any fees.\n\nReceive amount should be interpreted as the amount that should be added to the Payee's account, regardless of any interoperable transaction fees. The amount excludes possible internal Payee fees added by the Payee FSP.\n\n\nThe Payee FSP can choose if the actual receive amount for the Payee should be sent or not in the callback to the Payer FSP. The actual Payee receive amount should include any Payee FSP internal fees on the Payee.\nAll taxes are assumed to be FSP-internal, which means that taxes are not sent as part of the API. See Section 5.1.5 for more information regarding taxes.\nNote: Dynamic fees implemented using a Switch, or any other intermediary, are not supported in this version of the API.\n5.1.1 Non-Disclosing of Fees\nThe fees and commission payments related to an interoperable transaction when fees are not disclosed are shown in Figure 6. The fees and commission that are directly part of the API are identified by green text. The FSP internal fees, commission, and bonus payments are identified by red text. These are not part of the transaction between a Payer FSP and a Payee FSP, but the amount that the Payee will receive after any FSP internal fees can be sent for information by the Payee FSP.\nFor send amount (see Section 5.1.1.2 for more information), internal Payer FSP fees on the Payer will affect the amount that is sent from the Payer FSP. For example, if the Payer FSP has a fee of 1 USD for a 100 USD interoperable financial transaction, 99 USD is sent from the Payer FSP. For receive amount (see Section 5.1.1.1 for more information), internal Payer FSP fees on the Payer will not affect the amount that is sent from the Payer FSP. Internal Payer FSP bonus or commission on the Payer should be hidden regardless of send or receive amount.\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 6 -- Fees and commission related to interoperability when fees are not disclosed\nSee Section 5.1.3 for more information on the fee types sent in the Interoperability API.\n5.1.1.1 Non-Disclosing Receive Amount\nFigure 7 shows an example of non-disclosing receive amount, in which the Payer would like the Payee to receive exactly 100 USD. For non-disclosing receive amount, the Payer FSP need not set the internal rating of the transaction until after the quote has been received because the Payee FSP knows what amount it will receive.\nIn this example, the Payee FSP decides to give commission to the Payer FSP since funds are flowing to the Payee FSP, which will later be spent in some way; this results in a future fee income for the Payee FSP. The Payer FSP can then decide how much in fees should be taken from the Payer for cost-plus pricing. In this example, the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD from the Payer, which means that the Payer FSP will earn 2 USD in total, as the Payer FSP will also receive 1 USD in FSP commission from the Payee FSP.\nFigure 7\n\nFigure 7 -- Example of non-disclosing receive amount\nFigure 8\n\nFigure 8 -- Simplified view of money movement for non-disclosing receive amount example\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a non-disclosing receive amount quote, the equation in Listing 9 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, Payee FSP fee is payeeFspFee in Table 18, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 7\nTransfer amount = Quote Amount + Payee FSP Fee -- Payee FSP Commission\nListing 7 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for non-disclosing receive amount\n5.1.1.2 Non-Disclosing Send Amount\nFigure 9 shows an example of non-disclosing send amount, where the Payer would like to send 100 USD from the Payer's account. For non-disclosing send amount, the Payer FSP must rate (determine the internal transaction fees, commission, or both) the transaction before the quote is sent to the Payee FSP so that the Payee FSP knows how much in funds it will receive in the transaction. The actual amount withdrawn from the Payer's account is not disclosed, nor are the fees.\nIn the example, the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP would like to have 1 USD each in fees so that the amount that will be received by the Payee is 98 USD. The actual amount that will be received by the Payee is in this example (not mandatory) returned in the callback to the Payer FSP, in the element payeeReceiveAmount.\nFigure 9\n\nFigure 9 -- Example of non-disclosing send amount\nFigure 10\nFigure 10 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the non-disclosing send amount example.\n\nFigure 10 -- Simplified view of money movement for non-disclosing send amount example\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a non-disclosing send amount quote, the equation in Listing 8 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 8\nTransfer amount = Quote Amount -- Payee FSP Commission\nListing 8 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for non-disclosing send amount\nThe reason for a Payee FSP fee to be absent in the equation is that the Payer would like to send a certain amount from their account. The Payee will receive less funds instead of a fee being added on top of the amount.\nThe fees and commission payments related to an interoperable transaction when fees are disclosed can be seen in Figure 11. The fees and commission that are directly related to the API are marked with green text. Internal Payee fees, bonus, and commission are marked with red text, these will have an implication on the amount that is sent by the Payer and received by the Payee. They are not part of the interoperable transaction between a Payer FSP and a Payee FSP, but the actual amount to be received by the Payee after internal Payee FSP fees have been deducted can be sent for information by the Payee FSP.\nWhen disclosing of fees are used, the FSP commission that the Payee FSP sends should subsidize the transaction cost for the Payer. This means that any FSP commission sent from the Payee FSP will effectively pay either a part or all of the fees that the Payer FSP has added to the transaction. If the FSP commission amount from the Payee FSP is higher than the actual transaction fees for the Payer, the excess amount should be handled as a fee paid by Payee FSP to Payer FSP. Section 5.1.2.2.1 contains an example of excess FSP commission.\nFigure 11\n\nFigure 11 -- Fees and commission related to interoperability when fees\nare disclosed\nSee Section 5.1.3 for more information on the fee types sent in the Interoperability API.\n5.1.2.1 Disclosing Receive Amount\nFigure 12 shows an example of disclosing receive amount where the Payer would like the Payee to receive exactly 100 USD. For disclosing receive amount, the Payer FSP must internally rate the transaction before the quote request is sent to the Payee FSP, because the fees are disclosed. In this example, the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees from the Payer. The Payee FSP decides to give 1 USD in commission to subsidize the transaction, so that the transaction is free for the Payer.\n\nFigure 12 -- Example of disclosing receive amount\nFigure 13\nFigure 13 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the disclosing receive amount example.\n\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a disclosing receive amount quote, the equation in Listing 9 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, Payee FSP fee is payeeFspFee in Table 18, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 9\nTransfer amount = Quote Amount + Payee FSP Fee -- Payee FSP Commission\nListing 9 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for disclosing receive amount\n5.1.2.2 Disclosing Send Amount\nFigure 14 shows an example of disclosing send amount, where the Payer would like to send 100 USD from the Payer's account to the Payee. For disclosing send amount, the Payer FSP must rate the transaction before the quote request is sent to the Payee FSP, because the fees are disclosed. In this example, the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP would like to have 1 USD each in fees from the Payer.\nFigure 14\n\nFigure 14 -- Example of disclosing send amount\nFigure 15\nFigure 15 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the disclosing send amount example.\n\nFigure 15 -- Simplified view of money movement for disclosing send amount example\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a disclosing send amount quote, the equation in Listing 10 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, Payer Fee is fees in Table 17, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 10\nIf (Payer Fee Listing 10 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for disclosing send amount\nThe reason for a Payee FSP fee to be absent in the equation, is that the Payer would like to send a certain amount from their account. The Payee will receive less funds instead of a fee being added on top of the amount.\n5.1.2.2.1 Excess FSP Commission Example\nFigure 16 shows an example of excess FSP commission using disclosing send amount, where the Payer would like to send 100 USD from the Payer's account to the Payee. For disclosing send amount, the Payer FSP must rate the transaction before the quote request is sent to the Payee FSP, because the fees are disclosed. In this excess commission example, the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees from the Payer, and the Payee FSP gives 3 USD in FSP commission. Out of the 3 USD in FSP commission, 1 USD should cover the Payer fees, and 2 USD is for the Payer FSP to keep.\nFigure 16\n\nFigure 16 -- Example of disclosing send amount\nFigure 17\nFigure 17 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the excess commission using disclosing send amount example.\n\nFigure 17 -- Simplified view of money movement for excess commission using disclosing send amount example\n5.1.3 Fee Types\nAs can be seen in Figure 6 and Figure 11, there are two different fee and commission types in the Quote object between the\nFSPs:\n\nPayee FSP fee -- A transaction fee that the Payee FSP would like to have for the handling of the transaction.\n\nPayee FSP commission -- A commission that the Payee FSP would like to give to the Payer FSP (non-disclosing of fees) or subsidize the transaction by paying some or all fees from the Payer FSP (disclosing of fees). In case of excess FSP commission, the excess commission should be handled as the Payee FSP pays a fee to the Payer FSP, see Section 5.1.2.2.1 for an example.\n\n\n5.1.4 Quote Equations\nThis section contains useful equations for quoting that have not already been mentioned.\n5.1.4.1 Payee Receive Amount Relation to Transfer Amount\nThe amount that the Payee should receive, excluding any internal Payee FSP fees, bonus, or commission, can be calculated by the Payer FSP using the equation in Listing 11, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Payee FSP fee is payeeFspFee in Table 18, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 11\nPayee Receive Amount = Transfer Amount - Payee FSP Fee + Payee FSP Commission\nListing 11 -- Relation between transfer amount and Payee receive amount\nThe actual Payee receive amount including any internal Payee FSP fees can optionally be sent by the Payee FSP to the Payer FSP in the Quote callback, see element payeeReceiveAmount in Table 18.\n5.1.5 Tax Information\nTax information is not sent in the API, as all taxes are assumed to be FSP-internal. The following sections contain details pertaining to common tax types related to the API.\n5.1.5.1 Tax on Agent Commission\nTax on Agent Commission is tax for an Agent as a result of the Agent receiving commission as a kind of income. Either the Agent or its FSP has a relation with the tax authority, depending on how the FSP deployment is set up. As all Agent commissions are FSP-internal, no information is sent through the Interoperability API regarding Tax on Agent Commission.\n5.1.5.2 Tax on FSP Internal Fee\nFSPs could be taxed on FSP internal fees that they receive from the transactions; for example, Payer fees to Payer FSP or Payee fees to Payee FSP. This tax should be handled internally within the FSP and collected by the FSPs because they receive a fee.\n5.1.5.3 Tax on Amount (Consumption tax)\nExamples of tax on amount are VAT (Value Added Tax) and Sales Tax. These types of taxes are typically paid by a Consumer to the Merchant as part of the price of goods, services, or both. It is the Merchant who has a relationship with the tax authority, and forwards the collected taxes to the tax authority. If any VAT or Sales Tax is applicable, a Merchant should include these taxes in the requested amount from the Consumer. The received amount in the Payee FSP should then be taxed accordingly.\n5.1.5.4 Tax on FSP Fee\nIn the API, there is a possibility for a Payee FSP to add a fee that the Payer or Payer FSP should pay to the Payee FSP. The Payee FSP should handle the tax internally as normal when receiving a fee (if local taxes apply). This means that the Payee FSP should consider the tax on the fee while rating the financial transaction as part of the quote. The tax is not sent as part of the API.\n5.1.5.5 Tax on FSP Commission\nIn the API, there is a possibility for a Payee FSP to add a commission to either subsidize the transaction (if disclosing of fees) or incentivize the Payer FSP (if non-disclosing of fees).\n5.1.5.5.1 Non-Disclosing of Fees\nFor non-disclosing of fees, all FSP commission from the Payee FSP should understood as the Payer FSP receiving a fee from the Payee FSP. The tax on the received fee should be handled internally within the Payer FSP, similar to the way it is handled in Section 5.1.5.2.\n5.1.5.5.2 Disclosing of Fees\nIf the Payee FSP commission amount is less than or equal to the amount of transaction fees originating from the Payer FSP, then the Payee FSP commission should always be understood as being used for covering fees that the Payer would otherwise need to pay.\nIf the Payee FSP commission amount is higher than the fees from the Payer FSP, the excess FSP commission should be handled similarly as Section 5.1.5.5.1.\n5.1.6 Examples for each Use Case\nThis section contains one or more examples for each use case.\n5.1.6.1 P2P Transfer\nA P2P Transfer is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 18 for an example. In this example, the Payer would like the Payee to receive 100 USD. The Payee FSP decides to give FSP commission to the Payer FSP, because the Payee FSP will receive funds into the system. The Payer FSP would also like to have 1 USD in fee from the Payer, so the total fee that the Payer FSP will earn is 2 USD. 99 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP after deducting the FSP commission amount of 1 USD.\nFigure 18\n\nFigure 18 -- P2P Transfer example with receive amount\n5.1.6.1.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 19\nSee Figure 19 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the P2P Transfer example.\n\nFigure 19 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the P2P Transfer example\n5.1.6.2 Agent-Initiated Cash-In (Send amount)\nFigure 20 shows an example of an Agent-Initiated Cash-In where send amount is used. The fees are disclosed because the Payee (the customer) would like to know the fees in advance of accepting the Cash-In. In the example, the Payee would like to Cash-In a 100 USD bill using an Agent (the Payer) in the Payer FSP system. The Payer FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission. The Payee FSP decides to subsidize the transaction by 2 USD by giving 2 USD in FSP commission to cover the Payer FSP fees. 98 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP after deducting the FSP commission amount of 2 USD.\nFigure 20\n\nFigure 20 -- Agent-Initiated Cash-In example with send amount\n5.1.6.2.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 21 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In example with send amount.\nFigure 21\n\nFigure 21 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In with send amount example\n5.1.6.3 Agent-Initiated Cash-In\n(Receive amount)\nFigure 22 shows an example of Agent-Initiated Cash-In where receive amount is used. The fees are disclosed as the Payee (the Consumer) would like to know the fees in advance of accepting the Cash-In. In the example, the Payee would like to Cash-In so that they receive 100 USD using an Agent (the Payer) in the Payer FSP system. The Payer FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission; the Payee FSP decides to subsidize the transaction by 1 USD by giving 1 USD in FSP commission to cover 50% of the Payer FSP fees. 99 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP after deducting the FSP commission amount of 1 USD.\nFigure 22\n\nFigure 22 -- Agent-initiated Cash-In example with receive amount\n5.1.6.3.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 19\nSee Figure 23 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In example with receive amount.\n\nFigure 23 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In with receive amount example\n5.1.6.4 Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment\nA Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 24 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to buy goods or services worth 100 USD from a Merchant (the Payee) in the Payee FSP system. The Payee FSP would not like to charge any fees from the Payer, but 1 USD in an internal hidden fee from the Merchant. The Payer FSP wants 1 USD in fees from the Payer. 100 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 24\n\nFigure 24 -- Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.4.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 25\nSee Figure 25 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment example.\n\nFigure 25 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.5 Customer-Initiated Cash-Out\n(Receive amount)\nA Customer-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 26 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out so that they will receive 100 USD in cash. The Payee FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 102 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\n\nFigure 26 -- Customer-Initiated Cash-Out example (receive amount)\n5.1.6.5.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 27\nSee Figure 27 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with receive amount example.\n\nFigure 27 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with receive amount example\n5.1.6.6 Customer-Initiated Cash-Out\n(Send amount)\nA Customer-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, this\nexample is shown in Section 5.1.6.5. This section shows an example where send amount is used instead; see Figure 28 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out 100 USD from their account. The Payee FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 99 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 28\n\nFigure 28 -- Customer-Initiated Cash-Out example (send amount)\n5.1.6.6.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 29 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with send amount example.\nFigure 29\n\nFigure 29 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with send amount example\n5.1.6.7 Agent-Initiated Cash-Out\nAn Agent-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, in which the Payer FSP does not disclose any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 30 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out so that they will receive 100 USD in cash. The Payee FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 102 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 30\n\nFigure 30 -- Agent-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.7.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 31 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-Initiated Cash-Out example.\nFigure 31\n\nFigure 31 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.8 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment\nA Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 32 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to buy goods or services worth 100 USD from a Merchant (the Payee) in the Payee FSP system. The Payee FSP does not want any fees and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 100 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 32\n\nFigure 32 -- Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.8.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 33 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment example.\nFigure 33\n\nFigure 33 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.9 ATM-Initiated Cash-Out\nAn ATM-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, in which the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 34 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out so that they will receive 100 USD in cash. The Payee FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees to cover any ATM fees and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees. 101 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 34\n\nFigure 34 -- ATM-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.9.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 35 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the ATM-Initiated Cash-Out example.\nFigure 35\n\nFigure 35 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the ATM-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.10 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS\nA Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on a POS device is typically a receive amount, in which the Payer FSP does not disclose any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 36 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to buy goods or services worth 100 USD from a Merchant (the Payee) in the Payee FSP system. The Payee FSP decides to give 1 USD in FSP commission, and the Payer FSP decides to use the FSP commission as the transaction fee. 100 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 36\n\nFigure 36 -- Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS example\n5.1.6.10.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 37 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS example.\nFigure 37\n\nFigure 37 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the\nMerchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS example\n5.1.6.11 Refund\nFigure 38 shows an example of a Refund transaction of the entire amount of the example in Section 5.1.6.3, Agent-Initiated Cash-In (Receive amount)\nFigure 38\n\nFigure 38 -- Refund example\n5.1.6.11.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 39 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Refund example.\nFigure 39\n\nFigure 39 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Refund example\n5.2 Party Addressing\nBoth Parties in a financial transaction, (that is, the Payer and the Payee) are addressed in the API by a Party ID Type (element PartyIdType, Section 7.3.25), a Party ID (PartyIdentifier, Section 7.3.24), and an optional Party Sub ID or Type (PartySubIdOrType, Section 7.3.27). Some Sub-Types are pre-defined in the API for personal identifiers (PersonalIdentifierType, Section 7.5.7); for example, for passport number or driver's license number.\nThe following are basic examples of how the elements Party ID Type and Party ID can be used:\n\nTo use mobile phone number +123456789 as the counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to MSISDN and Party ID to +123456789.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/MSISDN/+123456789\n\n\n\nTo use the email john\\@doe.com as the counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to EMAIL, and Party ID to john\\@doe.com.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/EMAIL/john\\@doe.com\n\n\n\nTo use the IBAN account number SE45 5000 0000 0583 9825 7466 as counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to IBAN, and Party ID to SE4550000000058398257466 (should be entered without any whitespace).\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/IBAN/SE4550000000058398257466\n\n\n\n\nThe following are more advanced examples of how the elements Party ID\nType, Party ID, and Party Sub ID or Type can be used:\n\nTo use the person who has passport number 12345678 as counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to PERSONAL_ID, Party ID to 12345678, and Party Sub ID or Type to PASSPORT.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/PERSONAL_ID/123456789/PASSPORT\n\n\n\nTo use employeeId1 working in the company Shoe-company as counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to BUSINESS, Party ID to Shoe-company, and Party Sub ID or Type to employeeId1.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/BUSINESS/Shoe-company/employeeId1\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Restricted Characters in Party ID and Party Sub ID or Type\nBecause the Party ID and the Party Sub ID or Type are used as part of the URI (see Section 3.1.3), some restrictions exist on the ID:\n\nForward slash (/) is not allowed in the ID, as it is used by the Path (see Section 3.1.3.3), to indicate a separation of the Path.\n\nQuestion mark (?) is not allowed in the ID, as it is used to indicate the Query (see Section 3.1.3.4) part of the URI.\n\n\n5.3 Mapping of Use Cases to Transaction Types\nThis section contains information about how to map the currently supported non-bulk use cases in the API to the complex type TransactionType (see Section 7.4.18), using the elements TransactionScenario (see Section 7.3.32), and TransactionInitiator, (see Section 7.3.29).\nFor more information regarding these use cases, see API Use Cases.\n5.3.1 P2P Transfer\nTo perform a P2P Transfer, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to TRANSFER\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to CONSUMER.\n\n5.3.2 Agent-Initiated Cash In\nTo perform an Agent-Initiated Cash In, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to DEPOSIT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to AGENT.\n\n5.3.3 Agent-Initiated Cash Out\nTo perform an Agent-Initiated Cash Out, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to AGENT\n\n5.3.4 Agent-Initiated Cash Out Authorized on POS\nTo perform an Agent-Initiated Cash Out on POS, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to AGENT\n\n5.3.5 Customer-Initiated Cash Out\nTo perform a Customer-Initiated Cash Out, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to CONSUMER\n\n5.3.6 Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment\nTo perform a Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment, set elements as\nfollows:\n\nTransactionScenario to PAYMENT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to CONSUMER.\n\n5.3.7 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment\nTo perform a Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment, set elements as\nfollows:\n\nTransactionScenario to PAYMENT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to BUSINESS\n\n5.3.8 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment Authorized on POS\nTo perform a Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment, set elements as\nfollows:\n\nTransactionScenario to PAYMENT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to DEVICE\n\n5.3.9 ATM-Initiated Cash Out\nTo perform an ATM-Initiated Cash Out, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to DEVICE\n\n5.3.10 Refund\nTo perform a Refund, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to REFUND\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType depends on the initiator of the Refund.\n\nAdditionally, the Refund complex type, see Section 7.4.16, must be populated with the transaction ID of the original transaction that is to be refunded.\n6. API Services\nThis section introduces and details all services that the API supports for each resource and HTTP method. Each API resource and service is also mapped to a logical API resource and service described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\n6.1 High Level API Services\nOn a high level, the API can be used to perform the following actions:\n\nLookup Participant Information -- Find out in which FSP the counterparty in a financial transaction is located.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /participants.\n\n\nLookup Party Information -- Get information about the counterparty in a financial transaction.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /parties.\n\n\nPerform Transaction Request -- Request that a Payer transfer electronic funds to the Payee, at the request of the Payee. The Payer can approve or reject the request from the Payee. An approval of the request will initiate the actual financial transaction.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /transactionRequests.\n\n\nCalculate Quote -- Calculate all parts of a transaction that will influence the transaction amount; that is, fees and FSP commission.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /quotes for a single transaction quote; that is, one Payer to one Payee.\nUse the services provided by the API resource /bulkQuotes for a bulk transaction quote; that is, one Payer to multiple Payees.\n\n\nPerform Authorization -- Request the Payer to enter the applicable credentials when they have initiated the transaction from a POS, ATM, or similar device in the Payee FSP system.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /authorizations.\n\n\nPerform Transfer -- Perform the actual financial transaction by transferring the electronic funds from the Payer to the Payee, possibly through intermediary ledgers.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /transfers for single transaction; that is, one Payer to one Payee.\nUse the services provided by the API resource /bulkTransfers for bulk transaction; that is, one Payer to multiple Payees.\n\n\nRetrieve Transaction Information -- Get information related to the financial transaction; for example, a possible created token on successful financial transaction.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /transactions.\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Supported API services\nTable 5\nTable 5 includes high-level descriptions of the services that the API provides.

Depending on the scheme, the services should be supported, at a minimum, by either the individual FSPs or a common service.\nIf a common service (for example, an ALS) is supported in the scheme, the services provided by the resource /participants can also be used by the FSPs for adding and deleting information in that system.\n6.2.1 Service Details\nDifferent models are used for account lookup, depending on whether an ALS exists. The following sections describe each model in turn.\n6.2.1.1 No Common Account Lookup System\nFigure 40 shows how an account lookup can be performed if there is no common ALS in a scheme. The process is to ask the other FSPs (in sequence) if they \"own\" the Party with the provided identity and type pair until the Party can be found.\nIf this model is used, all FSPs should support being both client and server of the different HTTP GET services under the /participants resource. The HTTP POST or HTTP DELETE services under the /participants resource should not be used, as the FSPs are directly used for retrieving the information (instead of a common ALS).\nFigure 40\n\nFigure 40 -- How to use the services provided by /participants if there is no common Account Lookup System\n6.2.1.2 Common Account Lookup System\nFigure 41 shows how an account lookup can be performed if there is a common ALS in a scheme. The process is to ask the common Account Lookup service which FSP owns the Party with the provided identity. The common service is depicted as \"Account Lookup\" in the flows; this service could either be implemented by the switch or as a separate service, depending on the setup in the market.\nThe FSPs do not need to support the server side of the different HTTP GET services under the /participants resource; the server side of the service should be handled by the ALS. Instead, the FSPs (clients) should provide FSP information regarding its accounts and account holders (parties) to the ALS (server) using the HTTP POST (to create or update FSP information, see Section 6.2.2.2 and Section 6.2.2.3) and HTTP DELETE (to delete existing FSP information, see Section 6.2.2.4) methods.\nFigure 41\n\nFigure 41 -- How to use the services provided by /participants if there is a common Account Lookup System\n6.2.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client on the resource /participants.\n6.2.2.1 GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}\nAlternative URI: GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}\nLogical API service: Lookup Participant Information\nThe HTTP request GET /participants/{Type}/{ID} (or GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) is used to find out in which FSP the requested Party, defined by {Type}, {ID} and optionally {SubId}, is located (for example, GET /participants/MSISDN/123456789, or GET /participants/BUSINESS/shoecompany/employee1). See Section 5.1.6.11 for more information regarding addressing of a Party.\nThis HTTP request should support a query string (see Section 3.1.3 for more information regarding URI syntax) for filtering of currency. To use filtering of currency, the HTTP request GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ should be used, where XYZ is the requested currency.\nCallback and data model information for GET /participants/{Type}/{ID} (alternative GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}):\n\nCallback - PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}\nError Callback - PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/error\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n6.2.2.2 POST /participants\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Create Bulk Participant Information\nThe HTTP request POST /participants is used to create information on the server regarding the provided list of identities. This request should be used for bulk creation of FSP information for more than one Party. The optional currency parameter should indicate that each provided Party supports the currency.\nCallback and data model information for POST /participants:\n\nCallback -- PUT /participants/{ID}\nError Callback -- PUT /participants/{ID} /error\nData Model -- See Table 6\n\nTable 6\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrequestId\n1\nCorrelationId\nThe ID of the request, decided by the client.

See Section 5.1.6.11 for more information regarding addressing of a Party.\nCallback and data model information for POST /participants/{Type}/{ID} (alternative POST /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}):\n\nCallback -- PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}\nError Callback -- PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/error\nData Model -- See Table 7\n\nTable 7\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfspId\n1\nFspId\nFSP Identifier that the Party belongs to.\n\n\ncurrency\n0..1\nCurrency\nIndicate that the provided Currency is supported by the Party.\n\n\n\nTable 7 -- POST /participants/{Type}/{ID} (alternative POST /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) data model Hold me\n6.2.2.4 DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID}\nAlternative URI: DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}\nLogical API service: DELETE Participant Information\nThe HTTP request DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID} (or DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) is used to delete information on the server regarding the provided identity, defined by {Type} and {ID}) (for example, DELETE /participants/MSISDN/123456789), and optionally {SubId}. See Section 5.1.6.11 for more information regarding addressing of a Party.\nThis HTTP request should support a query string (see Section 3.1.3 for more information regarding URI syntax) to delete FSP information regarding a specific currency only. To delete a specific currency only, the HTTP request DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ should be used, where XYZ is the requested currency.\nNote: The ALS should verify that it is the Party's current FSP that is deleting the FSP information.\nCallback and data model information for DELETE /participants/{Type}/{ID} (alternative GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}):\n\nCallback -- PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}\n\nError Callback -- PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/error\n\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n\n6.2.3 Callbacks\nThis section describes the callbacks used by the server for services\nprovided by the resource /participants.\n6.2.3.1 PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}\nAlternative URI: PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}\nLogical API service: Return Participant Information\nThe callback PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID} (or PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) is used to inform the client of a successful result of the lookup, creation, or deletion of the FSP information related to the Party. If the FSP information is deleted, the fspId element should be empty; otherwise the element should include the FSP information for the Party.\nSee Table 8 for data model.\nTable 8\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfspId\n0..1\nFspId\nFSP Identifier that the Party belongs to.\n\n\n\nTable 8 -- PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID} (alternative PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) data model\n6.2.3.2 PUT /participants/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Return Bulk Participant Information\nThe callback PUT /participants/{ID} is used to inform the client of the result of the creation of the provided list of identities.\nSee Table 9 for data model.\nTable 9\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npartyList\n1..10000\nPartyResults\nList of PartyResult elements that were either created or failed to be created.\n\n\ncurrency\n0..1\nCurrency\nIndicate that the provided Currency was set to be supported by each successfully added PartyIdInfo.\n\n\n\nTable 9 -- PUT /participants/{ID} data model   \n6.2.4 Error Callbacks\nThis section describes the error callbacks that are used by the server under the resource /participants.\n6.2.4.1 PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/error\nAlternative URI: PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}/error\nLogical API service: Return Participant Information Error\nIf the server is unable to find, create or delete the associated FSP of the provided identity, or another processing error occurred, the error callback PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/error (or PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}/error) is used.

Alternative deployments could also exist; for example, a deployment in which the Switch and the ALS are in the same server, or one in which the User's FSP asks FSP 1 directly for information regarding the Party.\nFigure 42\n\nFigure 42 -- Example process for /parties resource\n6.3.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /parties.\n6.3.2.1 GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}\nAlternative URI: GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}\nLogical API service: Lookup Party Information\nThe HTTP request GET /parties/{Type}/{ID} (or GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) is used to lookup information regarding the requested Party, defined by {Type}, {ID} and optionally {SubId} (for example, GET /parties/MSISDN/123456789, or GET /parties/BUSINESS/shoecompany/employee1). See Section 5.1.6.11 for more information regarding addressing of a Party.\nCallback and data model information for GET /parties/{Type}/{ID} (alternative GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}):\n\nCallback - PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}\nError Callback - PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}/error\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n6.3.3 Callbacks\nThis section describes the callbacks that are used by the server for services provided by the resource /parties.\n6.3.3.1 PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}\nAlternative URI: PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}\nLogical API service: Return Party Information\nThe callback PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID} (or PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) is used to inform the client of a successful result of the Party information lookup.

The Payer can either approve or reject the request from the Payee. The decision by the Payer could be made programmatically if:\n\nThe Payee is trusted (that is, the Payer has pre-approved the Payee in the Payer FSP), or\n\nAn authorization value - that is, a one-time password (OTP) is correctly validated using the API Resource /authorizations, see Section 6.6.\n\n\nAlternatively, the Payer could make the decision manually.\n6.4.1 Service Details\nFigure 43 shows how the request transaction process works, using the /transactionRequests resource. The approval or rejection is not shown in the figure. A rejection is a callback PUT /transactionRequests/{ID} with a REJECTED state, similar to the callback in the figure with the RECEIVED state, as described in Section 6.4.1.1. An approval by the Payer is not sent as a callback; instead a quote and transfer are sent containing a reference to the transaction request.\nFigure 43\n\nFigure 43 -- How to use the /transactionRequests service\n6.4.1.1 Payer Rejected Transaction Request\nFigure 44 shows the process by which a transaction request is rejected. Possible reasons for rejection include:\n\nThe Payer rejected the request manually.\nAn automatic limit was exceeded.\nThe Payer entered an OTP incorrectly more than the allowed number of times.\n\nFigure 44\n\nFigure 44 -- Example process in which a transaction request is rejected\n6.4.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that a client can request on the resource /transactionRequests.\n6.4.2.1 GET /transactionRequests/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Transaction Request Information\nThe HTTP request GET /transactionRequests/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested transaction request.

This means that a client should expect that an error callback could be received for a rejected transaction request.\n\nFigure 45 -- Possible states of a transaction request\n6.5 API Resource /quotes\nThis section defines the logical API resource Quotes, described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nThe main service provided by the API resource /quotes is calculation of possible fees and FSP commission involved in performing an interoperable financial transaction. Both the Payer and Payee FSP should calculate their part of the quote to be able to get a total view of all the fees and FSP commission involved in the transaction.\nA quote is irrevocable; it cannot be changed after it has been created. However, it can expire (all quotes are valid only until they reach expiration).\nNote: A quote is not a guarantee that the financial transaction will succeed. The transaction can still fail later in the process. A quote only guarantees that the fees and FSP commission involved in performing the specified financial transaction are applicable until the quote expires.\nFor more information regarding Quoting, see Section 5.1.\n6.5.1 Service Details\nFigure 46 contains an example process for the API resource /quotes. The example shows a Payer Initiated Transaction, but it could also be initiated by the Payee, using the API Resource /transactionRequests, Section 6.4. The lookup process is in that case performed by the Payee FSP instead.\nFigure 46\n\nFigure 46 -- Example process for resource /quotes\n6.5.1.1 Quote Expiry Details\nThe quote request from the Payer FSP can contain an expiry of the quote, if the Payer FSP would like to indicate when it is no longer useful for the Payee FSP to return a quote. For example, the transaction itself might otherwise time out, or if its quote might time out.\nThe Payee FSP should set an expiry of the quote in the callback to indicate when the quote is no longer valid for use by the Payer FSP.\n6.5.1.2 Interledger Payment Request\nAs part of supporting Interledger and the concrete implementation of the Interledger Payment Request (see Section 4), the\nPayee FSP must:\n\nDetermine the ILP Address (see Section 4.3 for more information) of the Payee and the amount that the Payee will receive. Note that since the amount element in the ILP Packet is defined as an UInt64, which is an Integer value, the amount should be multiplied with the currency's exponent (for example, USD's exponent is 2, which means the amount should be multiplied by 102, and JPY's exponent is 0, which means the amount should be multiplied by 100). Both the ILP Address and the amount should be populated in the ILP Packet (see Section 4.5 for more information).\n\nPopulate the data element in the ILP Packet by the Transaction (Section 7.4.17) data model.\n\nGenerate the fulfilment and the condition (see Section 4.4 for more information). Populate the condition element in the PUT /quotes/{ID}(#6531-put-quotesid) (Table 18) data model with the generated condition.\n\nThe fulfilment is a temporary secret that is generated for each financial transaction by the Payee FSP and used as the trigger to commit the transfers that make up an ILP payment.\nThe Payee FSP uses a local secret to generate a SHA-256 HMAC of the ILP Packet. The same secret may be used for all financial transactions or the Payee FSP may store a different secret per Payee or based on another segmentation.\nThe choice and cardinality of the local secret is an implementation decision that may be driven by scheme rules. The only requirement is that the Payee FSP can determine which secret that was used when the ILP Packet is received back later as part of an incoming transfer (see Section 6.7).\nThe fulfilment and condition are generated in accordance with the algorithm defined in Listing 12. Once the Payee FSP has derived the condition, the fulfilment can be discarded as it can be regenerated later.\nListing 12\nGeneration of the fulfilment and condition\nInputs:\n\nLocal secret (32-byte binary string)\nILP Packet\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nLet the fulfilment be the result of executing the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm on the ILP Packet using the local secret as the key.\n\nLet the condition be the result of executing the SHA-256 hash algorithm on the fulfilment.\n\n\nOutputs:\n\nFulfilment (32-byte binary string)\nCondition (32-byte binary string)\n\nListing 12 -- Algorithm to generate the fulfilment and the condition\n6.5.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /quotes.\n6.5.2.1 GET /quotes/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Quote Information\nThe HTTP request GET /quotes/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested quote.

This means that a client should expect that an error callback could be received for an expired or rejected quote.\n\nFigure 47 -- Possible states of a quote\n6.6 API Resource /authorizations\nThis section defines the logical API resource Authorizations,described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nThe API resource /authorizations is used to request the Payer to enter the applicable credentials in the Payee FSP system for approving the financial transaction, when the Payer has initiated the transaction from a POS, ATM, or similar, in the Payee FSP system and would like to authorize by an OTP.\n6.6.1 Service Details\nFigure 48 contains an example process for the API resource /authorizations. The Payee FSP first sends a transaction request (see Section 6.4) that is authorized using OTP. The Payer FSP then performs the quoting process (see Section 6.5) before an authorization request is sent to the Payee FSP system for the Payer to approve by entering the OTP. If the OTP is correct, the transfer process should be initiated (see Section 6.7).\nFigure 48\n\nFigure 48 -- Example process for resource /authorizations\n6.6.1.1 Resend Authorization Value\nIf the notification containing the authorization value fails to reach the Payer, the Payer can choose to request a resend of the authorization value if the POS, ATM, or similar device supports such a request. See Figure 49 for an example of a process where the Payer requests that the OTP be resent.\nFigure 49\n\nFigure 49 -- Payer requests resend of authorization value (OTP)\n6.6.1.2 Retry Authorization Value\nThe Payer FSP must decide the number of times a Payer can retry the authorization value in the POS, ATM, or similar device. This will be set in the retriesLeft query string (see 3.1.3 for more information regarding URI syntax) of the GET /authorizations/{ID} service, see Section 6.6.2.1 for more information. If the Payer FSP sends retriesLeft=1, this means that it is the Payer's last try of the authorization value. See Figure 50 for an example process where the Payer enters the incorrect OTP, and the retriesLeft value is subsequently decreased.\nFigure 50\n\nFigure 50 -- Payer enters incorrect authorization value (OTP)\n6.6.1.3 Failed OTP authorization\nIf the user fails to enter the correct OTP within the number of allowed retries, the process described in Section 6.4.1.1 is performed.\n6.6.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /authorizations.\n6.6.2.1 GET /authorizations/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Perform Authorization\nThe HTTP request GET /authorizations/{ID} is used to request the Payer to enter the applicable credentials in the Payee FSP system. The {ID} in the URI should contain the transactionRequestID (see Table 14), received from the POST /transactionRequests (see Section 6.4.2.2) service earlier in the process.\nThis request requires a query string (see Section 3.1.3 for more information regarding URI syntax) to be included in the URI, with the following key-value pairs:\n\nauthenticationType={Type}, where {Type} value is a valid authentication type from the enumeration AuthenticationType (see Section 7.5.1).\nretriesLeft={NrOfRetries}, where {NrOfRetries} is the number of retries left before the financial transaction is rejected. {NrOfRetries} must be expressed in the form of the data type Integer (see Section 7.2.5). retriesLeft=1 means that this is the last retry before the financial transaction is rejected.\namount={Amount}, where {Amount} is the transaction amount that will be withdrawn from the Payer's account. {Amount} must be expressed in the form of the data type Amount (see Section 7.2.13).\ncurrency={Currency}, where {Currency} is the transaction currency for the amount that will be withdrawn from the Payer's account. The {Currency} value must be expressed in the form of the enumeration CurrencyCode (see Section 7.5.5).\n\nAn example URI containing all the required key-value pairs in the query string is the following:\nGET /authorization/3d492671-b7af-4f3f-88de-76169b1bdf88?authenticationType=OTP&retriesLeft=2&amount=102&currency=USD\nCallback and data model information for GET /authorization/{ID}:\n\nCallback - PUT /authorizations/{ID}\nError Callback - PUT /authorizations/{ID}/error\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n6.6.3 Callbacks\nThis section describes the callbacks that are used by the server under the resource /authorizations.\n6.6.3.1 PUT /authorizations/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Return Authorization Result\nThe callback PUT /authorizations/ {ID} is used to inform the client of the result of a previously-requested authorization. The {ID} in the URI should contain the {ID} that was used in the GET /authorizations/{ID}. See Table 20 for data model.\nTable 20\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nauthenticationInfo\n0..1\nAuthenticationInfo\nOTP or QR Code if entered, otherwise empty.\n\n\nresponseType\n1\nAuthorizationResponse\nEnum containing response information; if the customer entered the authentication value, rejected the transaction, or requested a resend of the authentication value.\n\n\n\nTable 20 – PUT /authorizations/{ID} data model\n6.6.4 Error Callbacks\nThis section describes the error callbacks that are used by the server under the resource /authorizations.\n6.6.4.1 PUT /authorizations/{ID}/error\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Return Authorization Error\nIf the server is unable to find the transaction request, or another processing error occurs, the error callback PUT /authorizations/{ID} /error is used. The {ID} in the URI should contain the {ID} that was used in the GET /authorizations/{ID}. See Table 21 for data model.\nTable 21\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nerrorInformation\n1\nErrorInformation\nError code, category description\n\n\n\nTable 21 -- PUT /authorizations/{ID}/error data model\n6.6.5 States\nThere are no states defined for the /authorizations resource.\n6.7 API Resource /transfers\nThis section defines the logical API resource Transfers, described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nThe services provided by the API resource /transfers are used for performing the hop-by-hop ILP transfer or transfers, and to perform the end-to-end financial transaction by sending the transaction details from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP. The transaction details are sent as part of the transfer data model in the ILP Packet.\nThe Interledger protocol assumes that the setup of a financial transaction is achieved using an end-to-end protocol, but that an ILP transfer is implemented on the back of hop-by-hop protocols between FSPs connected to a common ledger. In the current version of the API, the API Resource /quotes performs the setup of the financial transaction. Before a transfer can be performed, the quote must be performed to setup the financial transaction. See API Resource /quotes, Section 6.5, for more information.\nAn ILP transfer is exchanged between two account holders on either side of a common ledger. It is usually expressed in the form of a request to execute a transfer on the common ledger and a notification to the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has been reserved in their favor, including a condition that must be fulfilled to commit the transfer.\nWhen the Payee FSP presents the fulfilment to the common ledger, the transfer is committed in the common ledger. At the same time, the Payer FSP is notified that the transfer has been committed along with the fulfilment.\n6.7.1 Service Details\nThis section provides details regarding hop-by-hop transfers and end-to-end financial transactions.\n6.7.1.1 Process\nFigure 51 shows how the transaction process works using the POST /transfers service.\nFigure 51\n\nFigure 51 -- How to use the POST /transfers service\n6.7.1.2 Transaction Irrevocability\nThe API is designed to support irrevocable financial transactions only; this means that a financial transaction cannot be changed, cancelled, or reversed after it has been created. This is to simplify and reduce costs for FSPs using the API. A large percentage of the operating costs of a typical financial system is due to reversals of transactions.\nAs soon as a Payer FSP sends a financial transaction to a Payee FSP (that is, using POST /transfers including the end-to-end financial transaction), the transaction is irrevocable from the perspective of the Payer FSP. The transaction could still be rejected in the Payee FSP, but the Payer FSP can no longer reject or change the transaction. An exception to this would be if the transfer's expiry time is exceeded before the Payee FSP responds (see Section 6.7.1.3 and Section 6.7.1.5 for more information). As soon as the financial transaction has been accepted by the Payee FSP, the transaction is irrevocable for all parties.\n6.7.1.3 Expired Quote\nIf a server receives a transaction that is using an expired quote, the server should reject the transfer or transaction.\n6.7.1.4 Timeout and Expiry\nThe Payer FSP must always set a transfer expiry time to allow for use cases in which a swift completion or failure is needed. If the use case does not require a swift completion, a longer expiry time can be set. If the Payee FSP fails to respond before the expiry time, the transaction is cancelled in the Payer FSP. The Payer FSP should still expect a callback from the Payee FSP.\nShort expiry times are often required in retail scenarios, in which a customer may be standing in front of a merchant; both parties need to know if the transaction was successful before the goods or services are given to the customer.\nIn Figure 51, an expiry has been set to 30 seconds from the current time in the request from the Payer FSP, and to 20 seconds from the same time in the request from the Switch to the Payee FSP. This strategy of using shorter timeouts for each entity in the chain from Payer FSP to Payee FSP should always be used to allow for extra communication time.\nNote: It is possible that a successful callback might be received in the Payer FSP after the expiry time; for example, due to congestion in the network. The Payer FSP should allow for some extra time after the actual expiry time before cancelling the financial transaction in the system. If a successful callback is received after the financial transaction has been cancelled, the transaction should be marked for reconciliation and handled separately in a reconciliation process.\n6.7.1.5 Client Receiving Expired Transfer\nFigure 52 shows an example of a possible error scenario connected to expiry and timeouts. For some reason, the callback from the Payee FSP takes longer time to send than the expiry time in the optional Switch. This leads to the Switch cancelling the reserved transfer, and an error callback for the transfer is sent to the Payer FSP. Now the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP have two different views of the result of the financial transaction; the transaction should be marked for reconciliation.\nFigure 52\n\nFigure 52 -- Client receiving an expired transfer\nTo limit these kinds of error scenarios, the clients (Payer FSP and optional Switch in Figure 52) participating in the ILP transfer should allow some extra time after actual expiry time during which the callback from the server can be received. The client or clients should also query the server after expiry, but before the end of the extra time, if any callback from the server has been lost due to communication failure. Reconciliation could still be necessary though, even with extra time allowed and querying the server for the transaction.\n6.7.1.6 Optional Additional Clearing Check\nTo further limit the possibility of the scenario described in Section 6.7.1.5, a Payee FSP can (if the scheme allows it) use an optional clearing check before performing the actual transfer to the Payee, by requesting the transfer state from the Switch after the fulfilment has been sent to Switch. The request of the transfer state is performed by sending a GET /transfers/{ID} to the Switch.\nThe use of the check is a business decision made by the Payee FSP (if  the scheme allows it), based on the context of the transaction. For example, a Cash Out or a Merchant Payment transaction can be understood as a higher-risk transaction, because it is not possible to reverse a transaction if the customer is no longer present; a P2P Transfer can be understood as lower risk because it is easier to reverse.\nFigure 53 shows an example where the optional additional clearing check is used where the commit was successful in the Switch.\nFigure 53\n\nFigure 53 -- Optional additional clearing check\nIf the GET /transfers/{ID} is received by the Switch after PUT /transfers/{ID} from the Payee FSP, but before clearing has completed, the Switch should wait with sending the callback until clearing has completed with either a successful or unsuccessful result. If clearing has already occurred (as shown in Figure 53), the PUT /transfers/{ID} callback can be sent immediately.\nFigure 54 shows an example in which the commit in the Switch failed due to an expiry of the transfer. This is the same example as in Figure 52, but where no reconciliation is needed as the Payee FSP checks if the transfer was successful or not in the Switch before performing the actual transfer to the Payee.\nFigure 54\n\nFigure 54 -- Optional additional clearing check where commit in Switch failed\n6.7.1.7 Refunds\nInstead of supporting reversals, the API supports refunds. To refund a transaction using the API, a new transaction should be created by the Payee of the original transaction. The new transaction should revers the original transaction (either the full amount or a partial amount); for example, if customer X sent 100 USD to merchant Y in the original transaction, a new transaction where merchant Y sends 100 USD to customer X should be created. There is a specific transaction type to indicate a refund transaction; for example, if the quote of the transaction should be handled differently than any other type of transaction. The original transaction ID should be sent as part of the new transaction for informational and reconciliation purposes.\n6.7.1.8 Interledger Payment Request\nAs part of supporting Interledger and the concrete implementation of the Interledger Payment Request (see Section 4), the Payer FSP must attach the ILP Packet, the condition, and an expiry to the transfer. The condition and the ILP Packet are the same as those sent by the Payee FSP in the callback of the quote; see Section 6.5.1.2 for more information.\nThe end-to-end ILP payment is a chain of one or more conditional transfers that all depend on the same condition. The condition is provided by the Payer FSP when it initiates the transfer to the next ledger.\nThe receiver of that transfer parses the ILP Packet to get the Payee ILP Address and routes the ILP payment by performing another transfer on the next ledger, attaching the same ILP Packet and condition and a new expiry that is less than the expiry of the incoming transfer.\nWhen the Payee FSP receives the final incoming transfer to the Payee account, it extracts the ILP Packet and performs the following steps:\n\nValidates that the Payee ILP Address in the ILP Packet corresponds to the Payee account that is the destination of the transfer.\nValidates that the amount in the ILP Packet is the same as the amount of the transfer and directs the local ledger to perform a reservation of the final transfer to the Payee account (less any hidden receiver fees, see Section 5.1).\nIf the reservation is successful, the Payee FSP generates the fulfilment using the same algorithm that was used when generating the condition sent in the callback of the quote (see Section 6.5.1.2).\nThe fulfilment is submitted to the Payee FSP ledger to instruct the ledger to commit the reservation in favor of the Payee. The ledger will validate that the SHA-256 hash of the fulfilment matches the condition attached to the transfer. If it does, it commits the reservation of the transfer. If not, it rejects the transfer and the Payee FSP rejects the payment and cancels the previously-performed reservation.\n\nThe fulfilment is then passed back to the Payer FSP through the same ledgers in the callback of the transfer. As funds are committed on each ledger after a successful validation of the fulfilment, the entity that initiated the transfer will be notified that the funds it reserved have been committed and the fulfilment will be shared as part of that notification message.\nThe final transfer to be committed is the transfer on the Payer FSP's ledger where the reservation is committed from their account. At this point the Payer FSP notifies the Payer of the successful financial transaction.\n6.7.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /transfers.\n6.7.2.1 GET /transfers/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Transfer Information\nThe HTTP request GET /transfers/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested transfer.

The actual transaction will be performed as part of the transfer process. The service GET /transactions/{TransactionID} can then be used to get more information about the financial transaction that was performed as part of the transfer process.\nFigure 56\n\nFigure 56 -- Example transaction process\n6.8.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client on the resource /transactions.\n6.8.2.1 GET /transactions/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Transaction Information\nThe HTTP request GET /transactions/{ID} is used to get transaction information regarding a previously-created financial transaction.

This means that a client should expect a proper callback about a transaction (if it has been received by the server) when requesting information regarding the same.\n\nFigure 57 -- Possible states of a transaction\n6.9 API Resource /bulkQuotes\nThis section defines the logical API resource Bulk Quotes, described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nThe services provided by the API resource /bulkQuotes service are used for requesting the creation of a bulk quote; that is, a quote for more than one financial transaction. For more information regarding a single quote for a transaction, see API Resource /quotes Section 6.5.\nA created bulk quote object contains a quote for each individual transaction in the bulk in a Peer FSP. A bulk quote is irrevocable; it cannot be changed after it has been created However, it can expire (all bulk quotes are valid only until they reach expiration).\nNote: A bulk quote is not a guarantee that the financial transaction will succeed. The bulk transaction can still fail later in the process. A bulk quote only guarantees that the fees and FSP commission involved in performing the specified financial transaction are applicable until the bulk quote expires.\n6.9.1 Service Details\nFigure 58 shows how the bulk quotes process works, using the POST /bulkQuotes service. When receiving the bulk of transactions from the Payer, the Payer FSP should:\n\nLookup the FSP in which each Payee is; for example, using the API Resource /participants, Section 6.2.\n\nDivide the bulk based on Payee FSP. The service POST /bulkQuotes is then used for each Payee FSP to get the bulk quotes from each Payee FSP. Each quote result will contain the ILP Packet and condition (see Section 4.5 and Section 4.4) needed to perform each transfer in the bulk transfer (see API Resource /bulkTransfers, Section 6.10), which will perform the actual financial transaction from the Payer to each Payee.\n\n\nFigure 58\n\nFigure 58 -- Example bulk quote process\n6.9.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /bulkQuotes.\n6.9.2.1 GET /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Bulk Quote Information\nThe HTTP request GET /bulkQuotes/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested bulk quote.\nThe {ID} in the URI should contain the bulkQuoteId (see Table 27) that was used for the creation of the bulk quote.\nCallback and data model information for GET /bulkQuotes/{ID}:\n\nCallback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nError Callback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}/error\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n6.9.2.2 POST /bulkQuotes\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Calculate Bulk Quote\nThe HTTP request POST /bulkQuotes is used to request the creation of a bulk quote for the provided financial transactions on the server.\nCallback and data model information for POST /bulkQuotes:\n\nCallback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nError Callback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}/error\nData Model -- See Table 27\n\nTable 27\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nindividualQuoteResults\n0..1000\nIndividualQuoteResult\nFees for each individual transaction, if any of them are charged per transaction.\n\n\nexpiration\n1\nDateTime\nDate and time until when the quotation is valid and can be honored when used in the subsequent transaction request.\n\n\nextensionList\n0..1\nExtensionList\nOptional extension, specific to deployment.\n\n\n\nTable 27 -- POST /bulkQuotes data model\n6.9.3 Callbacks\nThis section describes the callbacks that are used by the server under the resource /bulkQuotes.\n6.9.3.1 PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Return Bulk Quote Information\nThe callback PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID} is used to inform the client of a requested or created bulk quote.

For more information about a single transfer, see API Resource /transfers (Section 6.7). Before a bulk transfer can be requested, a bulk quote needs to be performed. See API Resource /bulkQuotes, Section 6.9, for more information.\nA bulk transfer is irrevocable; it cannot be changed, cancelled, or reversed after it has been sent from the Payer FSP.\n6.10.1 Service Details\nFigure 60 shows how the bulk transfer process works, using the POST /bulkTransfers service. When receiving the bulk transactions from the Payer, the Payer FSP should perform the following:\n\nLookup the FSP in which each Payee is; for example, using the API Resource /participants, Section 6.2.\nPerform the bulk quote process using the API Resource /bulkQuotes, Section 6.9. The bulk quote callback should contain the required ILP Packets and conditions needed to perform each transfer.\nPerform bulk transfer process in Figure 60 using POST /bulkTransfers. This performs each hop-to-hop transfer and the end-to-end financial transaction.

API Supporting Data Models\nThis section provides information about additional supporting data models used by the API.\n7.1 Format Introduction\nThis section introduces formats used for element data types used by the API.\nAll element data types have both a minimum and maximum length. The length is indicated by a minimum and maximum length, an exact length, or a regular expression limiting the element in a way that only a specific length or lengths can be used.\n7.1.1 Minimum and Maximum Length\nIf a minimum and maximum length is required, it is indicated after the\ndata type in parentheses, first minimum (inclusive) value, followed by\n\"..\", and then maximum (inclusive) value.\nExamples:\n\nString(1..32) -- String that is minimum one character and maximum 32 characters long\n\nInteger(3..10) -- Integer that is minimum 3 digits, maximum 10 digits long\n\n\n7.1.2 Exact Length\nIf an exact length is used, it is indicated after the data type, in parentheses. One value is allowed only.\nExamples:\n\nString(3) -- String that is exactly three characters long\n\nInteger(4) -- Integer that is exactly 4 digits long\n\n\n7.1.3 Regular Expressions\nSome element data types are restricted using regular expressions. The regular expressions in this document are using the standard for syntax and character classes used in the Perl programming language30.\n7.2 Element Data Type Formats\nThis section defines element data types used by the API.\n7.2.1 String\nThe API data type String is a normal JSON String31, always limited by a minimum and maximum number of characters.\n7.2.1.1 Example Format\nString(1..32) -- A String that is minimum one character and maximum 32 characters long.\n7.2.1.1.1 Example\nAn example of String(1..32) appears below:\nThis String is 28 characters\n7.2.1.2 Example Format\nString(1..128) -- A String that is minimum one character and maximum 128 characters long.\n7.2.1.2.1 Example\nAn example of String(1..128) appears below:\nThis String is longer than 32 characters, but less than 128\n7.2.2 Enum\nThe API data type Enum is a restricted list of allowed JSON String (see Section 7.2.1) values; an enumeration of values. Other values than the ones defined in the list are not allowed.\n7.2.2.1 Example Format\nEnum of String(1..32) -- A String that is minimum one character and maximum 32 characters long and restricted by the allowed list of values. The description of the element contains a link to the enumeration.\n7.2.3 UndefinedEnum\nThe API data type UndefinedEnum is a JSON String consisting of 1 to 32 uppercase characters including an underscore character (_).\n7.2.3.1 Regular Expression\nThe regular expression for restricting the UndefinedEnum type appears in Listing 13.\nListing 13\n^[A-Z_]{1,32}$\nListing 13 -- Regular expression for data type UndefinedEnum\n7.2.4 Name\nThe API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular expression to avoid characters that are generally not used in a name.\n7.2.4.1 Regular Expression\nThe regular expression for restricting the Name type appears in Listing 14. The restriction does not allow a string consisting of whitespace only, all Unicode32 characters are allowed, as well as the period (.) (apostrophe ('), dash (-), comma (,) and space characters ( ). The maximum number of characters in the Name is 128.\nNote: In some programming languages, Unicode support must be specifically enabled. For example, if Java is used the flag UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS must be enabled to allow Unicode characters.\nListing 14\n^(?!\\s*$)[\\w .,'-]{1,128}$\nListing 14 -- Regular expression for data type Name\n7.2.5 Integer\nThe API data type Integer is a JSON String consisting of digits only.

Figure 62 shows the structure of an error code. The following sections contain information about defined error codes for each high-level error category.\n\nFigure 62 -- Error code structure\nEach defined high- and low-level category combination contains a generic error (x0xx), which can be used if there is no specific error, or if the server would not like to return information which is considered private.\nAll specific errors below xx40; that is, xx00 to xx39, are reserved for future use by the API. All specific errors above and including xx40 can be used for scheme-specific errors. If a client receives an unknown scheme-specific error, the unknown scheme-specific error should be interpreted as a generic error for the high- and low-level category combination instead (xx00).\n7.6.1 Communication Errors -- 1xxx\nAll possible communication or network errors that could arise that cannot be represented by an HTTP status code should use the high-level error code 1 (error codes 1xxx). Because all services in the API are asynchronous, these error codes should generally be used by a Switch in the Callback to the client FSP if the Peer FSP cannot be reached, or when a callback is not received from the Peer FSP within an agreed timeout.\nLow level categories defined under Communication Errors:\n\nGeneric Communication Error -- 10xx\n\nSee Table 99 for all communication errors defined in the API.\nTable 99\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotates\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n1000\nCommunication error\nGeneric communication error.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n1001\nDestination communication error\nDestination of the request failed to be reached.

These error codes should indicate that the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the requested service.\nLow-level categories defined under server errors:\n\nGeneric server error -- 20xx\n\nSee Table 100 for server errors defined in the API.\nTable 100\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotates\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n2000\nGeneric server error\nGeneric server error to be used in order not to disclose information that may be considered private.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n2001\nInternal server error\nGeneric unexpected exception.

These error codes should indicate that the server could not perform the service according to the request from the client. The server should provide an explanation why the service could not be performed.\nLow level categories defined under client Errors:\n\nGeneric Client Error -- 30xx\n\nSee Table 101 for generic client errors defined in the API.\n\n\nValidation Error -- 31xx\n\nSee Table 102 the validation errors defined in the API.\n\n\nIdentifier Error -- 32xx\n\nSee Table 103 for identifier errors defined in the API.\n\n\nExpired Error -- 33xx\n\nSee Table 104 for expired errors defined in the API.\n\n\n\nTable 101\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotates\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n3000\nGeneric client error\nGeneric client error, used in order not to disclose information that may be considered private.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n3001\nUnacceptable version requested\nClient requested to use a protocol version which is not supported by the server.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n3002\nUnknown URI\nProvided URI was unknown to the server.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n3003\nAdd Party information error\nError occurred while adding or updating information regarding a Party.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nTable 101 -- Generic client errors -- 30xx\nTable 102\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotates\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n3100\nGeneric validation error\nGeneric validation error to be used in order not to disclose information that may be considered private.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n3101\nMalformed syntax\nFormat of the parameter is not valid.

Generic Transaction Patterns Binding\nThis section provides information about how the logical transaction patterns from Generic Transaction Patterns are used in the asynchronous REST binding of the API. Much of the information is provided by way of sequence diagrams. For more information regarding the steps in these diagrams, see Generic Transaction Patterns.\n8.1 Payer Initiated Transaction\nThe Payer Initiated Transaction pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, the pattern should be used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to another Party whom is not located in the same FSP as the Payer. Figure 63 shows the sequence diagram for a Payer Initiated Transaction using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure 63\n\nFigure 63 -- Payer Initiated Transaction pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n8.2 Payee Initiated Transaction\nThe Payee Initiated Transaction pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, the pattern should be used whenever a Payee would like to request that Payer transfer funds to a Payee. The Payer and the Payee are assumed to be in different FSPs, and the approval of the transaction is performed in the Payer FSP. If the transaction information and approval occur on a Payee device instead, use the related Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP pattern described in Section 8.3 instead. Figure 64 shows the sequence diagram for a Payee Initiated Transaction using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure-64\n\nFigure 64 -- Payee Initiated Transaction pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n8.3 Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP\nThe Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, this pattern is like the Payee Initiated Transaction described in Section 8.2; however, in this pattern the transaction information and approval for the Payer is shown and entered on a Payee device instead. As in other transaction patterns, the Payer and the Payee are assumed to be in different FSPs. Figure 65 shows the sequence diagram for a Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure 65\n\nFigure 65 -- Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n8.4 Bulk Transactions\nThe Bulk Transaction pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, the pattern is used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to multiple Payees using one single transaction. The Payees can be in different FSPs. Figure 66 shows the sequence diagram for a Bulk Transactions using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure 66\n\nFigure 66 -- Bulk Transactions pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n9. API Error Handling\nThis section describes how to handle missing responses or callbacks, as well as how to handle errors in a server during processing of a request.\n9.1 Erroneous Request\nIf a server receives an erroneous service request that can be handled immediately (for example, malformed syntax or resource not found), a valid HTTP client error code (starting with 4xx39) should be returned to the client in the response. The HTTP error codes defined in the API appear in Table 3. The HTTP response may also contain an ErrorInformation element for the purpose of describing the error in more detail (for more information, see Section 3.2.4.1).\n9.2 Error in Server During Processing of Request\nFigure 67 shows an example of how to handle an error on a server during processing.\nFigure 67\n\nFigure 67 -- Error on server during processing of request\n9.2.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list describes the steps in the sequence (see Figure 67).\n\nThe client would like the server to create a new service object and thus uses a POST request.\n\nThe server receives the request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then tries to create the object based on the service request. A processing error occurs, and the request cannot be handled as requested. The server sends the callback PUT /{resource}/{ID}/error including an error code (Section 7.6) and error description to notify the client of the error.\n\nThe client receives the error callback and immediately responds with OK. The client then handles the error.\n\nThe server receives the OK response and the process is completed.\n\n\n9.3 Client Handling on Error Callback\nThe following sections explain how a client handles error callbacks from a server.\n9.3.1 API Resource /participants\nThe typical error from the /participants service is that the requested Party could not be found. The client could either try another server, or notify the end user that the requested Party could not be found.\n9.3.2 API Resource /parties\nThe typical error from the /parties service is that the requested Party could not be found. The client could either try another server, or notify the end user that information regarding the requested Party could not be found.\n9.3.3 API Resource /quotes\nThe typical error from the /quotes service is that a quote could not be calculated for the requested transaction. The client should notify the end user that the requested transaction could not be performed.\n9.3.4 API Resource /transactionRequests\nThe typical error from the /transactionRequests service is that the Payer rejected the transaction or that an automatic validation failed. The client should notify the Payee that the transaction request failed.\n9.3.5 API Resource /authorizations\nThe typical error from the /authorizations service is that the transaction request could not be found. The client should notify the Payer that the transaction request has been cancelled.\n9.3.6 API Resource /transfers\nThe typical error from the /transfers service is that either the hop-to-hop transfer process or the end-to-end financial transaction failed. For example, a limit breach was discovered, or the Payee could not be found. The client (the Payer FSP) should in any error case cancel the reservation for the financial transaction that was performed before requesting the transaction to be performed on the server (the Payee FSP). See Figure 68 for an example including a financial Switch between the FSPs.\nFigure 68\n\nFigure 68 -- Handling of error callback from POST /transfers\n9.3.6.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list provides a detailed description of all the steps in the sequence (see Figure 68).\n\nThe transfer is reserved from the Payer's account to either a combined Switch account or a Payee FSP account, depending on setup. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request POST /transfers is used on the Switch. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP. The Payer FSP then waits for an accepted response from the Switch.\n\nThe Switch receives the request POST /transfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Payer FSP. The Switch then performs all applicable internal transfer validations. If the validations are successful, a transfer is reserved from a Payer FSP account to a Payee FSP account. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request POST /transfers is used on the Payee FSP. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Switch. The Switch then waits for an accepted response from the Payee FSP.\n\nThe Payee FSP receives the POST /transfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Switch. The Payee FSP then performs all applicable internal transaction validations. The validation is assumed to fail at this point, for example, due to a limit breach. The error callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error is used on the Switch to inform the Payer FSP about the error. The Payee FSP then waits for an OK response from the Switch to complete the transfer process.\n\nThe Switch receives the error callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Switch then cancels the earlier reserved transfer, as it has received an error callback. The Switch will then use the callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error to the Payer FSP, using the same parameters, and wait for an OK response to complete the transfer process.\n\nThe Payer FSP receives the callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Payer FSP then cancels the earlier reserved transfer because it has received an error callback.\n\n\n9.3.7 API Resource /transactions\nThe normal error case from the /transactions service is that the transaction could not be found in the Peer FSP.\n9.3.8 API Resource /bulkQuotes\nThe typical error from the /bulkQuotes service is that a quote could not be calculated for the requested transaction. The client should notify the end user that the requested transaction could not be performed.\n9.3.9 API Resource /bulkTransfers\nThe typical error case from the /bulkTransfers service is that the bulk transaction was not accepted; for example, due to a validation error. The client (the Payer FSP) should in any error case cancel the reservation for the financial transaction that was performed before requesting that the transaction be performed on the server (the Payee FSP). See Figure 69 for an example including a financial Switch between the FSPs.\nFigure 69\n\nFigure 69 -- Handling of error callback from API Service /bulkTransfers\n9.3.9.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list describes the steps in the sequence (see Figure 69).\n\nEach individual transfer in the bulk transfer is reserved from the Payer's account to either a combined Switch account or a Payee FSP account, depending on setup. After each transfer has been successfully reserved, the request POST /bulkTransfers is used on the Switch. The bulk transfer is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP. The Payer FSP then waits for an accepted response from the Switch.\n\nThe Switch receives the request POST /bulkTransfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Payer FSP. The Switch then performs all applicable internal transfer validations. If the validations are successful, each individual transfer is reserved from a Payer FSP account to a Payee FSP account. After the transfers have been successfully reserved, the request POST /bulkTransfers is used on the Payee FSP. The bulk transfer is now irrevocable from the Switch. The Switch then waits for an accepted response from the Payee FSP.\n\nThe Payee FSP receives POST /bulkTransfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Switch. The Payee FSP then performs all applicable internal bulk transfer validations. The validation is assumed to fail due to some reason; for example, a validation failure that prevents the entire bulk transfer from being performed. The error callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error is used on the Switch to inform the Payer FSP about the error. The Payee FSP then waits for an OK response from the Switch to complete the bulk transfer process.\n\nThe Switch receives the error callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Switch then cancels all the previous reserved transfers, because it has received an error callback. The Switch then uses the callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error to the Payer FSP, using the same parameters, and waits for an OK response to complete the bulk transfer process.\n\nThe Payer FSP receives the callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Payer FSP then cancels all the earlier reserved transfers, as it has received an error callback.\n\n\n9.4 Client Missing Response from Server - Using Resend of Request\nFigure 70 shows an example UML (Unified Modeling Language) sequence diagram in which a client (FSP or Switch) performs error handling when the client misses a response from a server (Switch or Peer FSP) pertaining to a service request, using resend of the same service request.\nFigure 70\n\nFigure 70 -- Error handling from client using resend of request\n9.4.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list provides a detailed description of all the steps in the sequence (see Figure 70).\n\nThe client would like the server to create a new service object. The HTTP request is lost somewhere on the way to the server.\n\nThe client notes that no response has been received from the server within a specified timeout. The client resends the service request.\n\nThe server receives the resent request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then creates the object in accordance with the service request.\n\nThe accepted HTTP response from the server is lost on the way to the client, and the client notes that no response has been received from the server within a specified timeout. The client resends the service request.\n\nThe server receives the resent request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then notes that the service request is the same as in Step 3. As the service request is a resend, the server should not create a new object based on the service request. The server sends a callback to notify the client about the object created in Step 3.\n\nThe client receives the callback regarding the created object. The client sends an OK HTTP response to the server to complete the process.\n\nThe server receives the OK HTTP response from the client, completing the process.\n\n\n9.5 Server Missing Response from Client\nA server using the API is not responsible for making sure that a callback is properly delivered to a client. However, it is considered good practice to retry if the server does not receive an OK response from the client.\n9.5.1 Client Missing Callback - Using GET request\nFigure 71 is a UML sequence diagram showing how a client (Switch or Peer FSP) would perform error handling in case of no callback from a client (FSP or Switch) within a reasonable time.\nFigure 71\n\nFigure 71 -- Error handling from client using GET request\n9.5.2 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list provides a detailed description of all the steps in the sequence (see Figure 71).\n\nThe client would like the server to create a new service object; a service request is sent.\n\nThe server receives the service request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then creates the object based on the service request. The object creation is a long running process; for example, a bulk transfer consisting of numerous financial transactions.\n\nThe server notes that no callback has been received from the client within a reasonable time. The client uses a GET service request with the ID that was provided in the original service request.\n\nThe server receives the GET service request. The server sends an accepted HTTP response to the client to notify that the request will be handled.\n\nThe client receives the accepted HTTP response and waits for the callback, which arrives sometime later; the client sends an OK HTTP response and the process is completed.\n\nThe server sends the callback to the client containing the requested information, and an OK HTTP response is received from the client, which completes the process.\n\n\n39 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -     Client Error 4xx\n10. End-to-End Example\nThis section contains an end-to-end example in which an account holder is provisioned, and then a P2P Transfer from a Payer located in one FSP to a Payee located in another FSP is performed. The example includes both HTTP requests and responses, HTTP headers, and data models in JSON, but without additional security features of using JWS (see Signature) and field level encryption using JWE (see Encryption).\n10.1 Example Setup\nThis section explains the setup of the example.\n10.1.1 Nodes\nFigure 72\nThe nodes in the end-to-end example in this section are simplified by having only two FSPs, where one FSP is a bank (identifier BankNrOne) and the other FSP is a mobile money operator (identifier MobileMoney), and one Switch (identifier Switch). The Switch also acts as the Account Lookup System (ALS) in this simplified setup (see Figure 72).\n\nFigure 72 -- Nodes in end-to-end example\n10.1.2 Account Holders\nThe account holders in the example are:\n\nOne account holder in the FSP BankNrOne named Mats Hagman. Mats Hagman has a bank account with IBAN number SE4550000000058398257466. The currency of the account is USD.\n\nOne account holder in the FSP MobileMoney named Henrik Karlsson. Henrik Karlsson has a mobile money account that is identified by his phone number 123456789. The currency of the account is USD.\n\n\n10.1.3 Scenario\nThe scenario in the example is that Mats Hagman in FSP BankNrOne wants to transfer 100 USD to Henrik Karlsson in the FSP MobileMoney. Before Henrik Karlsson can be found by FSP BankNrOne, Henrik's FSP MobileMoney should provide information to the Switch specifying in which FSP Henrik Karlsson can be found in. The end-to-end flow including all used services can be found in Section 10.1.4.\n10.1.4 Other Notes\nThe JSON messages used in the examples are formatted with color coding, indentations, and line breaks for very long lines to simplify the read of the examples.\nBoth FSPs are assumed to have a pre-funded Switch account in their respective FSPs.\n10.2 End-to-End Flow\nFigure 73 shows the end-to-end flow of the entire example, from provisioning of FSP information to the actual transaction.\nFigure 73\n\nFigure 73 -- End-to-end flow, from provision of account holder FSP information to a successful transaction\n10.3 Provision Account Holder\nBefore the Payee Henrik Karlsson can be found by the Payer FSP BankNrOne, Henrik Karlsson should be provisioned to the ALS, which is also the Switch in this simplified example, by Henrik's FSP (MobileMoney). This is performed through either one of the services POST /participants (bulk version) or POST /participants/{Type}/{ID} (single version). As the Payee in this example is only one (Henrik Karlsson), the single POST /participants/{Type}/{ID} version is used by FSP MobileMoney. The provision could happen anytime, for example when Henrik Karlsson signed up for the financial account, or when the FSP MobileMoney connected to the Switch for the first time.\n10.3.1 FSP MobileMoney Provisions Henrik Karlsson -- Step 1 in End-to-End Flow\nListing 29 shows the HTTP request where the FSP MobileMoney provisions FSP information for account holder Henrik Karlsson, identified by MSISDN and 123456789 (see Section 5.2 for more information about Party Addressing). The JSON element fspId is set to the FSP identifier (MobileMoney), and JSON element currency is set to the currency of the account (USD).\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request,\nand Section 6.2.2.3 for more information about the service POST /participants/{Type}/{ID}.

An example verification is to check that the fspId element is the same as the FSPIOP-Source , as it should be the FSP of the account holder who provisions the information. A scheme could also have restrictions on which currencies are allowed, which means that the Switch should then check that the currency in the currency element is allowed.\nAfter the Switch has verified the request correctly, the information that the account holder identified by MSISDN and 123456789 is located in FSP MobileMoney should be stored in the Switch's database.\n10.3.3 Switch Sends Successful Callback -- Step 3 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the Switch has successfully stored the information that the account holder identified by MSISDN and 123456789 is located in FSP MobileMoney, the Switch must send a callback using the service PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID} to notify the FSP MobileMoney about the outcome of the request in Listing 29. Listing 31 shows the HTTP request for the callback.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request. In the callback, the Accept header should not be used as this is a callback to an earlier requested service. The HTTP headers FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are now inverted compared to the HTTP request in Listing 29, as detailed in Section 3.2.3.5. See Section 6.2.3.1 for more information about the callback [PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}](#6231-put-participantstypeid.\nListing 31\nPUT /participants/MSISDN/123456789 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Length: 50\nContent-Type:\nDate: Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:12:32 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: MobileMoney\nFSPIOP-Destination: Switch\n{\n    \"fspId\": \"MobileMoney\",\n    \"currency\": \"USD\"\n}\nListing 31 -- Callback for the earlier requested provision service\nListing 32 shows the asynchronous HTTP response where the FSP MobileMoney immediately (after basic verification of for example required headers) acknowledges the completion of the process, after receiving the callback in Listing 31.\nSee Table 2 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP response.\nListing 32\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type:\napplication/vnd.interoperability.participants+json;version=1.0\nListing 32 -- Asynchronous response for the callback\n10.4 P2P Transfer\nAs the intended Payee Henrik Karlsson is now known by the Switch (which is also the ALS) as detailed in Section 10.3, Mats Hagman can now initiate and approve the use case P2P Transfer from his bank to Henrik Karlsson.\n10.4.1 Initiate Use Case -- Step 4 in End-to-End Flow\nMats Hagman knows that Henrik Karlsson has phone number 123456789, so he inputs that number on his device as recipient and 100 USD as amount. The actual communication between Mats' device and his bank BankNrOne is out of scope for this API.\n10.4.2 Request Party Information from Switch -- Step 5 in End-to-End Flow\nIn Step 5 in the end-to-end flow, BankNrOne receives the request from Mats Hagman that he would like the phone number 123456789 to receive 100 USD. BankNrOne performs an internal search to see if 123456789 exists within the bank, but fails to find the account internally. BankNrOne then uses the service GET /parties/{Type}/{ID} in the Switch to see if the Switch knows anything about the account.\nListing 33 shows the HTTP request where the FSP BankNrOne asks the Switch for Party information regarding the account identified by MSISDN and 123456789.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.3.2.1 for more information about the service GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5 in this request, the FSP BankNrOne does not know in which FSP the other account holder resides. Thus, the FSPIOP-Destination is not present.

As that information was provisioned as detailed in Section 10.3, the Switch knows that the account is in FSP MobileMoney. Therefore, the Switch sends the HTTP request in Listing 35.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.3.2.1 for more information about the service GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5; in this request the Switch has added the header FSPIOP-Destination because the Switch knew to where the request should be routed.

As the account exists and is owned by Henrik Karlsson, the FSP MobileMoney sends the callback in Listing 37. The FSP MobileMoney does not want to share some details, for example birth date, with the other FSP (BankNrOne), so some optional elements are not sent.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request,\nand Section 6.3.3.1 for more information about the callback PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}.

It also knows the name of the account holder. Depending on implementation, the name of the intended Payee (Henrik Karlsson) could be shown to Mats Hagman already in this step before sending the quote. In this example, a quote request is sent before showing the name and any fees.\nThe FSP BankNrOne sends the HTTP request in Listing 39 to request the quote. BankNrOne does not want to disclose its fees (see Section 5.1 for more information about quoting), which means that it does not include the fees element in the request. The amountType element is set to RECEIVE as Mats wants Henrik to receive 100 USD. The transactionType is set according to Section 5.3. Information about Mats is sent in the payer element. BankNrOne has also generated two UUIDs for the quote ID (7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6) and the transaction ID (85feac2f-39b2-491b-817e-4a03203d4f14). These IDs must be unique, as described in Section 3.1.1.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.5.2.2 for more information about the service POST /quotes.

Since the Payee Henrik Karlsson should receive 100 USD and the FSP commission is determined to 1 USD, the FSP BankNrOne only needs to transfer 99 USD to the FSP MobileMoney (see Section 5.1.1.1 for the equation). The 99 USD is entered in the transferAmount element in the callback, which is the amount that should later be transferred between the FSPs.\nTo send the callback, the FSP MobileMoney then needs to create an ILP Packet (see Section 4.5 for more information) that is base64url-encoded, as the ilpPacket element in the PUT /quotes/{ID} callback is defined as a BinaryString (see Section 7.2.17). How to populate the ILP Packet is explained in Section 6.5.1.2. Henrik's ILP address in the FSP MobileMoney has been set to g.se.mobilemoney.msisdn.123456789 (see Section 4.3 for more information about ILP addressing). As the transfer amount is 99 USD and the currency USD's exponent is 2, the amount to be populated in the ILP Packet is 9900 (99 * 10\\^2 = 9900). The remaining element in the ILP Packet is the data element. As described in Section 6.5.1.2, this element should contain the Transaction data model (see Section 7.4.17). With the information from the quote request, the Transaction in this example becomes as shown in Listing 41. Base64url-encoding the entire ILP Packet with the amount, account, and the data element then results in the ilpPacket element in the PUT /quotes/{ID} callback.\nWhen the ILP Packet has been created, the fulfilment and the condition can be generated as defined in the algorithm in Listing 12. Using a generated example secret shown in Listing 42 (shown as base64url-encoded), the fulfilment becomes as in Listing 43 (shown as base64url-encoded) after executing the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm on the ILP Packet using the generated secret as key. The FSP MobileMoney is assumed to save the fulfilment in the database, so that it does not have to be regenerated later. The condition is then the result of executing the SHA-256 hash algorithm on the fulfilment, which becomes as in Listing 44 (shown as base64url-encoded).\nThe complete callback to the quote request becomes as shown in Listing 45.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.5.3.1 for more information about the callback PUT /quotes/{ID}. The {ID} in the URI should be taken from the quote ID in the quote request, which in the example is 7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6. In the callback, the Accept header should not be sent. The HTTP headers FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are now inverted compared to the HTTP request in Listing 39, as detailed in Section 3.2.3.5.\nListing 41\n{\n    \"transactionId\": \"85feac2f-39b2-491b-817e-4a03203d4f14\",\n    \"quoteId\": \"7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6\",\n    \"payee\": {\n        \"partyIdInfo\": {\n            \"partyIdType\": \"MSISDN\",\n            \"partyIdentifier\": \"123456789\",\n            \"fspId\": \"MobileMoney\"\n        },\n        \"personalInfo\": {\n            \"complexName\": {\n                \"firstName\": \"Henrik\",\n                \"lastName\": \"Karlsson\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"payer\": {\n        \"personalInfo\": {\n            \"complexName\": {\n                \"firstName\": \"Mats\",\n                \"lastName\": \"Hagman\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"partyIdInfo\": {\n            \"partyIdType\": \"IBAN\",\n            \"partyIdentifier\": \"SE4550000000058398257466\",\n            \"fspId\": \"BankNrOne\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"amount\": {\n        \"amount\": \"99\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    },\n    \"transactionType\": {\n        \"scenario\": \"TRANSFER\",\n        \"initiator\": \"PAYER\",\n        \"initiatorType\": \"CONSUMER\"\n    },\n    \"note\": \"From Mats\"\n}\nListing 41 -- The Transaction JSON object\nListing 42\nJdtBrN2tskq9fuFr6Kg6kdy8RANoZv6BqR9nSk3rUbY\nListing 42 -- Generated secret, encoded in base64url\nListing 43\nmhPUT9ZAwd-BXLfeSd7-YPh46rBWRNBiTCSWjpku90s\nListing 43 -- Calculated fulfilment from the ILP Packet and secret, encoded in base64url\nListing 44\nfH9pAYDQbmoZLPbvv3CSW2RfjU4jvM4ApG\\_fqGnR7Xs\nListing 44 -- Calculated condition from the fulfilment, encoded in base64url\nListing 45\nPUT /quotes/7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.quotes+json;version=1.0\nContent-Length: 1802\nDate: Tue, 15 Nov 2017 10:13:41 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: MobileMoney\nFSPIOP-Destination: BankNrOne\n{\n    \"transferAmount\": {\n        \"amount\": \"99\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    },\n    \"payeeReceiveAmount\": {\n        \"amount\": \"100\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    },\n    \"expiration\": \"2017-11-15T14:17:09.663+01:00\",\n    \"ilpPacket\": \"AQAAAAAAACasIWcuc2UubW9iaWxlbW9uZXkubXNpc2RuLjEyMzQ1Njc4OY-\nIEIXsNCiAgICAidHJhbnNhY3Rpb25JZCI6ICI4NWZlY-\nWMyZi0zOWIyLTQ5MWItODE3ZS00YTAzMjAzZDRmMTQiLA0KICAgICJxdW90ZUlkIjogIjdjMjNlOD-\nBjLWQwNzgtNDA3Ny04MjYzLTJjMDQ3ODc2ZmNmNiIsDQogICAgInBheWVlIjogew0KICAgICAgI-\nCAicGFydHlJZEluZm8iOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAicGFydHlJZFR5cGUiOiAiTVNJU0ROIiwNCiAgI-\nCAgICAgICAgICJwYXJ0eUlkZW50aWZpZXIiOiAiMTIzNDU2Nzg5IiwNCiAgICAgICAgI-\nCAgICJmc3BJZCI6ICJNb2JpbGVNb25leSINCiAgICAgICAgfSwNCiAgICAgI-\nCAgInBlcnNvbmFsSW5mbyI6IHsNCiAgICAgICAgICAgICJjb21wbGV4TmFtZSI6IHsNCiAgICAgICAgI-\nCAgICAgICAiZmlyc3ROYW1lIjogIkhlbnJpayIsDQogICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgImxhc3ROYW1lIjogIk-\nthcmxzc29uIg0KICAgICAgICAgICAgfQ0KICAgICAgICB9DQogICAgfSwNCiAgICAicGF5ZXIi-\nOiB7DQogICAgICAgICJwZXJzb25hbEluZm8iOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAiY29tcGxleE5hbWUi-\nOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgImZpcnN0TmFtZSI6ICJNYXRzIiwNCiAgICAgICAgICAgICAgI-\nCAibGFzdE5hbWUiOiAiSGFnbWFuIg0KICAgICAgICAgICAgfQ0KICAgICAgICB9LA0KICAgICAgI-\nCAicGFydHlJZEluZm8iOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAicGFydHlJZFR5cGUiOiAiSUJBTiIsDQogICAgI-\nCAgICAgICAicGFydHlJZGVudGlmaWVyI-\njogIlNFNDU1MDAwMDAwMDA1ODM5ODI1NzQ2NiIsDQogICAgICAgICAgICAiZnNwSWQiOiAiQmFua05yT25\nlIg0KICAgICAgICB9DQogICAgfSwNCiAgICAiYW1vdW50Ijogew0KICAgICAgICAiYW1vdW50IjogIjEw-\nMCIsDQogICAgICAgICJjdXJyZW5jeSI6ICJVU0QiDQogICAgfSwNCiAgICAidHJhbnNhY3Rpb25UeXBlI-\njogew0KICAgICAgICAic2NlbmFyaW8iOiAiVFJBTlNGRVIiLA0KICAgICAgICAiaW5pdGlhdG9yI-\njogIlBBWUVSIiwNCiAgICAgICAgImluaXRpYXRvclR5cGUiOiAiQ09OU1VNRVIiDQogICAgfSwNCiAgI-\nCAibm90ZSI6ICJGcm9tIE1hdHMiDQp9DQo\\u003d\\u003d\",\n    \"condition\": \"fH9pAYDQbmoZLPbvv3CSW2RfjU4jvM4ApG_fqGnR7Xs\"\n}\nListing 45 -- Quote callback\nNote: The element ilpPacket in Listing 45 should be on a single line in a real implementation;

In this example, the fee for the Payer is set to 0 USD, but the FSP commission from the FSP MobileMoney is kept as an income for the FSP BankNrOne. This means that for the Payee Henrik Karlsson to receive 100 USD, the Payer Mats Hagman must transfer 100 USD from his account. 99 USD will then be transferred between the FSPs BankNrOne and MobileMoney.\nThe FSP BankNrOne then notifies Mats Hagman that the transaction to transfer 100 USD to Henrik Karlsson will cost 0 USD in fees. How Mats Hagman is notified is out of scope of this API.\n10.4.11 Payer Accepts Transaction -- Step 14 in End-to-End Flow\nIn this example, Mats Hagman accepts to perform the transaction. How the acceptance is sent is outside the scope of this API.\n10.4.12 Send Transfer Request from FSP BankNrOne -- Step 15 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen Mats Hagman has accepted the transaction, FSP BankNrOne reserves the internal transfers needed to perform the transaction. This means that 100 USD will be reserved from Mats Hagman's account, where 1 USD will end up as income for the FSP and 99 USD will be transferred to the prefunded Switch account. After the reservations are successfully performed, the FSP BankNrOne sends a POST /transfers to the Switch as in Listing 47. The same ilpPacket and condition elements are sent as was received in the quote callback and the amount is the same as the received transferAmount, see Listing 45.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.7.2.2 for more information about the service POST /transfers. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5.

The transferState is set to COMMITTED and the completedTimestamp is set to when the transaction was completed; see Listing 50 for the complete HTTP request.\nAt the same time, a notification is sent to the Payee Henrik Karlsson to\nsay that he has received 100 USD from Mats Hagman.\nHow the notification is sent is out of scope for this API.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.7.3.1 for more information about the callback PUT /transfers/{ID}. The {ID} in the URI should be taken from the transfer ID in the transfer request, which in the example is 11436b17-c690-4a30-8505-42a2c4eafb9d. In the callback, the Accept header should not be sent. The HTTP headers FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are now inverted compared to the HTTP request in Listing 47, as detailed in Section 3.2.3.5.\nListing 50\nPUT /transfers/11436b17-c690-4a30-8505-42a2c4eafb9d HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.transfers+json;version=1.0\nContent-Length: 166\nDate: Tue, 15 Nov 2017 10:14:02 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: MobileMoney\nFSPIOP-Destination: BankNrOne\n{\n    \"fulfilment\": \"mhPUT9ZAwd-BXLfeSd7-YPh46rBWRNBiTCSWjpku90s\",\n    \"completedTimestamp\": \"2017- 11-16T04:15:35.513+01:00\",\n    \"transferState\": \"COMMITTED\"\n}\nListing 50 -- Callback for the transfer request\nListing 51 shows the asynchronous HTTP response in which the Switch immediately (after basic verification of for example required headers) acknowledges the completion of the process, after receiving the callback in Listing 50.\nSee Table 2 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP response.\nListing 51\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.transfers+json;version=1.0\nListing 51 -- Asynchronous response on the transfers callback\n10.4.15 Payee Receives Transaction Notification -- Step 18 in End-to-End Flow\nThe Payee Henrik Karlsson receives the transaction notification, and is thereby informed of the successful transaction.\n10.4.16 Perform Transfer in Switch -- Step 19 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the Switch has received the transfer callback in Listing 50 and sent the asynchronous response in Listing 51, it should validate the fulfilment, perform the earlier reserved transfer and relay the exact same callback as in Listing 50 to the FSP BankNrOne, and BankNrOne should then respond asynchronously with the same response as in Listing 51.\nThe validation of the fulfilment is done by calculating the SHA-256 hash of the fulfilment and ensuring that the hash is equal to the condition from the transfer request.\nThe HTTP request and response are not repeated in this section, as they are the same as in the last section, but sent from the Switch to BankNrOne (HTTP request in Listing 50) and from BankNrOne to the Switch (HTTP response in Listing 51) instead.\n10.4.17 Perform Transfer in FSP BankNrOne -- Step 20 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the FSP BankNrOne has received the transfer callback in Listing 50 and sent the asynchronous response in Listing 51, the FSP BankNrOne should validate the fulfilment (see Section 10.4.16) and then perform the earlier reserved transfer.\nAfter the reserved transfer has been performed, the Payer Mats Hagman should be notified of the successful transaction.

Introduction\nThis document defines scheme rules for Open API for FSP Interoperability (hereafter cited as the API) in three categories.\n\nBusiness Scheme Rules:\n a. These business rules should be governed by FSPs and an optional regulatory authority implementing the API within a scheme.\n b. The regulatory authority or implementing authority should identify valid values for these business scheme rules in their API policy document.\n\nAPI implementation Scheme Rules:\n a. These API parameters should be agreed on by FSPs and the optional Switch. These parameters should be part of the implementation policy of a scheme.\n b. All participants should configure these API parameters as indicated by the API-level scheme rules for the implementation with which they are working.\n\nSecurity and Non-Functional Scheme Rules.\n a. Security and non-functional scheme rules should be determined and identified in the implementation policy of a scheme. \n\n\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\n\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\n\nUse Cases\n\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\n\nJSON Binding Rules\n\nScheme Rules\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\n\nSignature\n\nEncryption\n\n\n3. Business Scheme Rules\nThis section describes the business scheme rules. The data model for the parameters in this section can be found in API Definition.\n3.1 Authentication Type\nThe authentication type scheme rule controls the authentication types OTP and QR code. It lists the various authentication types available for Payer authentication. A scheme can choose to support all the authentication types mentioned in “AuthenticationTypes” in API Definition or a subset thereof.\n3.2 Consumer KYC Identification Required\nA scheme can mandate verification of consumer KYC (Know Your Customer) identification by Agent or Merchant at the time of transaction (for example, cash-out, cash-in, merchant payment). The API cannot control this scheme rule; therefore, it should be documented in scheme policy so that it is followed by all participants in a scheme. The scheme can also decide on the valid KYC proof of identification that should be accepted by all FSPs.\n3.3 Currency\nA scheme may recommend allowing transactions in more than one currency. This scheme may define the list of valid currencies in which transactions can be performed by participants; however, this is not required. A Switch may work as transaction router and doesn’t validate the transaction currency. If a scheme does not define the list of valid currencies, then the Switch works as transaction router and the participating FSP can accept or reject the transaction based on its supported currencies. Foreign exchange is not supported; that is, the transaction currency for the Payer and the Payee should be the same.\n3.4 FSP ID Format\nA scheme may determine the format of the FSP ID. The FSP ID should be of string type. Each participant will be issued a unique FSP ID by the scheme. Each FSP should prepend the FSP ID to a merchant code (a unique identifier for a merchant) so that the merchant code is unique across all the participants (that is, across the scheme). The scheme can also determine an alternate strategy to ensure that FSP IDs and merchant codes are unique across participating FSPs.\n3.5 Interoperability Transaction Type\nThe API supports the use cases documented in Use Cases. A scheme may recommend implementation of all the supported usecases or a subset thereof. A scheme may also recommend to rollout the use cases in phases. Two or more FSPs in the scheme might decide to implement additional use-cases supported by the API. A Switch may work as a transaction router and does not validate transaction type; the FSP can accept or reject the transaction based on its supported transaction types. If a participant FSP initiates a supported API transaction type due to incorrect configuration on the Payer end, then the transaction must be rejected by the peer FSP if the peer FSP doesn’t support the specific transaction type.\n3.6 Geo-Location Required\nThe API supports geolocation of the Payer and the Payee; however, this is optional. A scheme can mandate the geolocation of transactions. In this case, all participants must send the geolocation of their respective party.\n3.7 Extension Parameters\nThe API supports one or more extension parameters. A scheme can recommend that the list of extension parameters be supported. All participants must agree with the scheme rule and support the scheme-mandatory extension parameters.\n3.8 Merchant Code Format\nThe API supports merchant payment transaction. Typically, a consumer either enters or scans a merchant code to initiate merchant payment. In case of merchant payment, the merchant code should be unique across all the schemes. Currently, the merchant code is not unique in the way that mobile numbers or email addresses are unique. Therefore, it is recommended to prepend a prefix or suffix (FSP ID) to the merchant code so that the merchant code is unique across the FSPs.\n3.9 Max Size Bulk Payments\nThe API supports the Bulk Payment use-case. The scheme can define the maximum number of transactions in a bulk payment.\n3.10 OTP Length\nThe API supports One-time Password (OTP) as authentication type. A scheme can define the minimum and maximum length of OTP to be used by all FSPs.\n3.11 OTP Expiration Time\nAn OTP’s expiration time is configured by each FSP. A scheme can recommend it to be uniform for all schemes so that users from different FSPs have a uniform user experience.\n3.12 Party ID Types\nThe API supports account lookup system. An account lookup can be performed based on valid party ID types of a party. A scheme can choose which party ID types to support from PartyIDType in API Definition.\n3.13 Personal Identifier Types\nA scheme can choose the valid or supported personal identifier types mentioned in PersonalIdentifierType in API Definition.\n3.14 QR Code Format\nA scheme should standardize the QR code format in the following two scenarios as indicated.\n3.14.1 Payer-Initiated transaction\nPayer scans the QR code of Payee (Merchant) to initiate a Payer-Initiated Transaction. In this case, the QR code should be standardized to include the Payee information, transaction amount, transaction type and transaction note, if any. The scheme should standardize the format of QR code for Payee.\n3.14.2 Payee-Initiated Transaction\nPayee scans the QR code of Payer to initiate Payee-Initiated transaction. For example: Merchant scans the QR code of Payer to initiate a Merchant Payment. In this case, the QR code should be standardized to locate the Payer without using the account lookup system. The scheme should standardize the format of QR code; that is, FSP ID, Party ID Type and Payer ID, or only Party ID Type and Party ID.\n4. API Implementation Scheme Rules\nThis section describes API implementation scheme rules.\n4.1 API Version\nAPI version information must be included in all API calls as defined in API Definition. A scheme should recommend that all FSPs implement the same version of the API.\n4.2 HTTP or HTTPS\nThe API supports both HTTP and HTTPS. A scheme should recommend that the communication is secured using TLS (see Section 5.6).\n4.3 HTTP Timeout\nFSPs and Switch should configure HTTP timeout. If FSP doesn’t get HTTP response (either HTTP 202 or HTTP 200) for the POST or PUT request then FSP should timeout. Refer to the diagram in Figure 1 for the HTTP 202 and HTTP 200 timeouts shown in dashed lines.\nFigure-1\n\nFigure 1 – HTTP Timeout\n4.4 Callback Timeouts\nThe FSPs and the Switch should configure callback timeouts. The callback timeouts of the initiating FSP should be greater than the callback timeout of the Switch. A scheme should determine callback timeout for the initiating FSP and the Switch. Refer to the diagram in Figure 2 for the callback timeouts highlighted in red.\nFigure-2\n\nFigure 2 – Callback Timeout\n5. Security and Non-Functional Requirements Scheme Rules\nThis section describes the scheme rules for security, environment and other network requirements.\n5.1 Clock Synchronization\nIt is important to synchronize clocks between FSPs and Switches. It is recommended that an NTP server or servers be used for clock synchronization.\n5.2 Data Field Encryption\nData fields that need to be encrypted will be determined by national and local laws, and any standard that must be complied with. Encryption should follow Encryption.\n5.3 Digital Signing of Message\nA scheme can decide that all messages must be signed as described in Signature.

Introduction\nThe purpose of this document is to express the data model used by the Open API for FSP Interoperability (hereafter cited as \"the API\") in the form of JSON Schema binding rules, along with the validation rules for their corresponding instances.\nThis document adds to and builds on the information provided in Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification. The contents of the Specification are listed in Section 2.1.\nThe types used in the PDP API fall primarily into three categories:\n\nBasic data types and Formats used\n\nElement types\n\nComplex types\n\n\nThe various types used in API Definition, Data Model and the Open API Specification, as well as the JSON transformation rules to which their instances must adhere, are identified in the following sections.\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\n\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\n\nUse Cases\n\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\n\nJSON Binding Rules\n\nScheme Rules\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\n\nSignature\n\nEncryption\n\n\n3. Keywords and Usage\nThe keywords used in the JSON Schemas and rules are derived from JSON Schema Specification1. The types of keywords used are identified in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. As discussed in detail later, some of these keywords specify validation parameters whereas others are more descriptive, such as Metadata. The description that follows specifies details such as whether a field MUST2 be present in the definition and whether a certain field is associated with a particular data type.\n3.1 Validation Keywords\nThis section3 provides descriptions of the keywords used for validation in API Definition. Validation keywords in a schema impose requirements for successful validation of an instance.\n3.1.1 maxLength\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer. A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. The length of a string instance is defined as the number of its characters as defined by RFC 7159[RFC7159].\n3.1.2 minLength\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer. A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. The length of a string instance is defined as the number of its characters as defined by RFC 7159[RFC7159]. Omitting this keyword has the same behaviour as assigning it a value of 0.\n3.1.3 pattern\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a string. This string SHOULD be a valid regular expression, according to the ECMA 262 regular expression dialect. A string instance is considered valid if the regular expression matches the instance successfully. Recall: regular expressions are not implicitly anchored.\n3.1.4 items\nThe value of items MUST be either a valid JSON Schema or an array of valid JSON Schemas. This keyword determines how child instances validate for arrays; it does not directly validate the immediate instance itself. If items is a schema, validation succeeds if all elements in the array successfully validate against that schema. If items is an array of schemas, validation succeeds if each element of the instance validates against the schema at the same position, if such a schema exists. Omitting this keyword has the same behaviour as specifying an empty schema.\n3.1.5 maxItems\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer. An array instance is valid against maxItems if its size is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword.\n3.1.6 minItems\nThe value of this keyword MUST be a non-negative integer. An array instance is valid against minItems if its size is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. Omitting this keyword has the same behaviour as a value of 0.\n3.1.7 required\nThe value of this keyword MUST be an array. Elements of this array (if there are any) MUST be strings and MUST be unique. An object instance is valid against this keyword if every item in the array is the name of a property in the instance. Omitting this keyword results in the same behaviour as does having the array be empty.\n3.1.8 properties\nThe value of properties MUST be an object. Each value of this object MUST be a valid JSON Schema. This keyword determines how child instances validate for objects; it does not directly validate the immediate instance itself. Validation succeeds if, for each name that appears in both the instance and as a name within this keyword's value, the child instance for that name successfully validates against the corresponding schema. Omitting this keyword results in the same behaviour as does having an empty object.\n3.1.9 enum\nThe value of this keyword MUST be an array. This array SHOULD have at least one element. Elements in the array SHOULD be unique. An instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value is equal to one of the elements in this keyword's array value. Elements in the array might be of any value, including null.\n3.1.10 type\nThe value of this keyword MUST be either a string or an array. If it is an array, elements of the array MUST be strings and MUST be unique. String values MUST be one of the six primitive types (null, boolean, object, array, number, or string), or integer which matches any number with a zero-fractional part. An instance validates if and only if the instance is in any of the sets listed for this keyword.\nThis specification uses string type for all basic types and element types, but enforces restrictions using regular expressions as patterns. Complex types are of object type and contain properties that are either element or object types in turn. Array types are used to specify lists, which are currently only used as part of complex types.\n3.2 Metadata Keywords\nThis section provides descriptions of the fields used in the JSON definitions of the types used. The description specifies whether a field MUST be present in the definition and specifies whether a certain field is associated with a primary data type. Validation keywords in a schema impose requirements for successful validation of an instance.\n3.2.1 definitions\nThis keyword's value MUST be an object. Each member value of this object MUST be a valid JSON Schema. This keyword plays no role in validation. Its role is to provide a standardized location for schema authors to incorporate JSON Schemas into a more general schema.\n3.2.2 \"title\" and \"description\"\nThe value of both keywords MUST be a string. Both keywords can be used to provide a user interface with information about the data produced by this user interface. A title will preferably be short, whereas a description will provide explanation about the purpose of the instance described in this schema.\n3.3 Instance and $ref\nTwo keywords, Instance and $ref are used in either the JSON Schema definitions or the transformation rules in this document, which are described in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2. Instance is not used in the Open API Specification; this term is used in this document to describe validation and transformation rules. $ref contains a URI value as a reference to other types; it is used in the Specification.\n3.3.1 Instance\nJSON Schema interprets documents according to a data model. A JSON value interpreted according to this data model is called an instance4. An instance has one of six primitive types, and a range of possible values depending on the type:\nnull: A JSON null production\nboolean: A true or false value, from the JSON true or false productions\nobject: An unordered set of properties mapping a string to an instance, from the JSON object production\narray: An ordered list of instances, from the JSON array production\nnumber: An arbitrary-precision, base-10 decimal number value, from the JSON number production\nstring: A string of Unicode code points, from the JSON string production\nWhitespace and formatting concerns are outside the scope of the JSON Schema. Since an object cannot have two properties with the same key, behaviour for a JSON document that tries to define two properties (the member production) with the same key (the string production) in a single object is undefined.\n3.3.2 Schema references with $ref keyword\nThe $ref5 keyword is used to reference a schema and provides the ability to validate recursive structures through self- reference. An object schema with a $ref property MUST be interpreted as a \"$ref\" reference. The value of the $ref property MUST be a URI Reference. Resolved against the current URI base, it identifies the URI of a schema to use. All other properties in a \"$ref\" object MUST be ignored.\nThe URI is not a network locator, only an identifier. A schema need not be downloadable from the address if it is a network- addressable URL, and implementations SHOULD NOT assume they should perform a network operation when they encounter a network-addressable URI. A schema MUST NOT be run into an infinite loop against a schema. For example, if two schemas \"#alice\" and \"#bob\" both have an \"allOf\" property that refers to the other, a naive validator might get stuck in an infinite recursive loop trying to validate the instance. Schemas SHOULD NOT make use of infinite recursive nesting like this; the behavior is undefined.\nIt is used with the syntax \"$ref\" and is mapped to an existing definition. From the syntax, the value part of $ref, #/definitions/, indicates that the type being referenced is from the Definitions section of the Open API Specification (Typically, an Open API Specification has sections named Paths, Definitions, Responses and Parameters.). An example for this can be found in Listing 26, where the types for properties authentication and authenticationValue are provided by using references to Authenticationtype and AuthenticationValue types, respectively.\n3.4 JSON Definitions and Examples\nJSON definitions and examples are provided after most sections defining the transformation rules, where relevant. These are provided in JSON form, taken from the JSON version of the Open API Specification. The Regular Expressions in the examples may have minor differences (sometimes having an additional '\\' symbol) when compared to the ones in rules and descriptions because the regular expressions in the examples are taken from the JSON version whereas the rules and descriptions are from the standard Open API (Swagger) Specification. They are provided in the relevant section as a numbered Listing. For example, Listing 1 provides the JSON representation of the definition of data type Amount.\nFor each of the data types, a description of the JSON Schema from the Open API Specification and (where relevant) an example of that type are provided. Following the Schema description are transformation rules that apply to an instance of that particular type.\n4. Element and Basic Data Types\nThis section contains the definitions of and transformation rules for the basic formats and element types used by the API as specified in API Definition and API Data Model. These definitions are basic in the context of the API specification, but not the Open API Technical Specification. Often, these basic data types are derived from the basic types supported by Open API Specification standards, such as string type.\n4.1 Data Type Amount\nThis section provides the JSON Schema definition for the data type Amount. Listing 1 provides a JSON Schema for the Amount type.\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"title\" and Value \"Amount\"\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"type\" and Value \"string\"\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"pattern\" and Value \"^([0]|([1-9][0-9]{0,17}))([.][0-9]{0,3}[1-9])?$\"\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"description\" and Value \"The API data type Amount is a JSON String in a canonical format that is restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons. This pattern does not allow any trailing zeroes at all, but allows an amount without a minor currency unit. It also only allows four digits in the minor currency unit; a negative value is not allowed. Using more than 18 digits in the major currency unit is not allowed.\"\n\n\nListing 1\n\"Amount\": {\n    \"title\": \"Amount\", \n    \"type\": \"string\", \n    \"pattern\":\n    \"^([0]|([1-9][0-9]{0,17}))([.][0-9]{0,3}[1-9])?$\",\n    \"maxLength\": 32, \n    \"description\": \"The API data type Amount is a JSON String in a canonical format that is restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons.\" \n}\n\nListing 1 -- JSON Schema for Data type Amount\nThe transformation rules for an instance of Amount data type are as follows:\n\nA given Instance of Amount type MUST be of String Type.\n\nThe instance MUST be a match for the regular expression ^([0]|([1-9][0-9]{0,17}))([.][0-9]{0,3}[1-9])?$\n\nThe length of this instance is restricted by the regular expression above as 23, with 18 digits in the major currency unit and four digits in the minor currency unit. Valid example values for Amount type: 124.45, 5, 5.5, 4.4444, 0.5, 0, 181818181818181818\n\n\n4.2 Data Type BinaryString\nThis section provides the JSON Schema definition for the data type BinaryString. Listing 2 provides a JSON Schema for the BinaryString type.\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"type\" and Value \"string\"\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"title\" and Value \"BinaryString\"\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"pattern\" and Value \"^[A-Za-z0-9-_]+[=]{0,2}$\"\n\nJSON value pair with Name \"description\" and Value the content of Property description\n\n\nListing 2\n\"BinaryString\":{\n    \"title\":\"BinaryString\",\n    \"type\":\"string\", \n    \"pattern\":\"^[A-Za-z0-9-_]+[=]{0,2}$\", \n    \"description\":\"The API data type BinaryString is a JSON String. The string is the base64url encoding of a string of raw bytes, where padding (character '=') is added at the end of the data if needed to ensure that the string is a multiple of 4 characters. The length restriction indicates the allowed number of characters.\n}\n\nListing 2 -- JSON Schema for Data type BinaryString\nSection 4.2.1 gives an example for BinaryString type.\nThe transformation rules for an instance of BinaryString data type are as follows:\n\nA given Instance of BinaryString type MUST be of String Type.\n\nThe instance MUST be a match for the regular expression ^[A-Za-z0-9-_]+[=]{0,2}$\n\n\nAn example value for BinaryString type is\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\n\n4.2.1 BinaryString Type IlpPacket\nThis section provides the JSON Schema definition for the BinaryString type IlpPacket.

Introduction\nThis document explains Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)1 best practices to apply in an Open API for FSP Interoperability (hereafter cited as “the API”) deployment. See Section 3, PKI Background, for more information about PKI.\nThe API should be implemented in an environment that consists of either:\n\nFinancial Service Providers (FSPs) that communicate with other FSPs (in a bilateral setup) or\n\nA Switch that acts as an intermediary platform between FSP platforms. There is also an Account Lookup System (ALS) available to identify in which FSP an account holder is located.\n\n\nFor more information about the environment, see Section 4, Network Topology. \nSections 5 and Section 6 identify management strategies for the CA and for the platform. \nCommunication between platforms is performed using a REST (REpresentational State Transfer)-based HTTP protocol (for more information, see API Definition). Because this protocol does not provide a means for ensuring either integrity or confidentiality between platforms, extra security layers must be added to protect sensitive information from alteration or exposure to unauthorized parties.\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\nUse Cases\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\nJSON Binding Rules\nScheme Rules\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\nSignature\nEncryption\n\n3. PKI Background\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a set of standards, procedures, and software for implementing authentication using public key cryptography. PKI is used to request, install, configure, manage and revoke digital certificates. PKI offers authentication using digital certificates; these digital certificates are signed and provided by Certificate Authorities (CA).\nPKI uses public key cryptography and works with X.509 standard certificates. It also provides features such as:\n\nUser authentication\n\nCertificate production and distribution\n\nCertificate maintenance, management, and revocation\n\n\nPKI consists of a number of components that enable the infrastructure to work; it is not a single process or algorithm. In addition to authentication, PKI also enables the provision of integrity, non-repudiation and encryption.\nTo obtain a public key, a company must obtain a digital certificate. It should request this certificate from a CA or a Registration Authority (RA) - an organization that processes requests on behalf of a CA. All participants must trust the CA to manage and maintain certificates. The CA requires the company to supply a number of details (Common Name (CN), Organization (O), Country (C) and so on) and validate their request before it provides a certificate. This certificate is proof that the company is who it says it is in the digital world (like a passport in the real world).\nPKI combines well with a Diffie-Hellman solution (a secure mechanism for exchanging a shared symmetric key between two anonymous peers) in providing secure key exchanges. Because Diffie-Hellman does not provide authentication, PKI is used with additional protocols, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n3.1 Layered Protection\nThe API should be used with protection at both the transport- and application-level.\n3.1.1 Transport-Level Protection\nTo protect the transport level, Transport Layer Security2 (TLS) should be used. TLS is a fundamental technique used for securing point-to-point communication. It has been proven to be stable and secure when using strong algorithms with the most recent versions of TLS, and is widely used around the world. TLS is a secure mechanism for exchanging a shared symmetric key between two anonymous peers, with identity verification (that is, trusted certificates). It provides confidentiality (no one has read the content) and integrity (no one has changed the content). Using TLS efficiently as-is requires certificate management.\n3.1.2 Application-Level Protection\nThis layer provides end-to-end integrity and confidentiality. The API uses the JSON Web Signature3 (JWS) standard for integrity and non-repudiation (provide proof of the integrity and origin of data), and the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) 4 standard for confidentiality. An extended version of JWE is used to support field level encryption.\nUsing these standards requires certificate management; therefore, Certificate Authorities (CA) and related PKI techniques are needed. For more information, see PKI Background.\n4. Network Topology\nThis section identifies the platforms that constitute the API.\n4.1 Platforms Point-to-Point Layout\nFigure 1 shows an example platform point-to-point layout.\n\nFigure 1 - Platforms layout\nAll communication between platforms must be TLS-secured using client authentication, also known as mutual authentication.\n4.2 Platform Roles\n4.2.1 Certificate Authority (CA)\nThe CA performs the following functions:\n\nSign Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) - CSRs is a secure mechanism for exchanging a shared symmetric key between two anonymous peers. The CA signs different types of certificates (for example, TLS, Content signature, Content encryption).\n\nRevoke certificates – Mark one or more certificates as invalid.\n\nSupport CRLs – Maintain and provide certificate revocation lists (CRLs) to be downloaded by clients so that they can see which certificates have been revoked.\n\nSupport Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) – Provide real-time certificate revocation checks. \n\n\n4.2.2 Account Lookup System (ALS)\n\nHolds basic information about account holders.\n\nAnswer questions like “Where should I send my financial transaction request for account holder with MSISDN 0123456?” \n\n\n4.2.3 Financial Services Provider (FSP)\nHas account holders to which or from which money is transferred.\n4.2.4 Switch\n\nRelays transaction information to other platforms.\n\nCan perform financial services, as specified in API Definition.\n\n\n5. Certificate Authority PKI Management Strategy\nThis section describes the PKI management strategy for Certificate Authorities.\n5.1 Certificate Authority Importance and Selection Criteria\nThe Certificate Authority (CA) role is important because:\n\nThe CA provides a single legal entity that is trustworthy for all platforms.\n\nThe point-to-point TLS protocol depends on certificates.\n\nThe end-to-end protocols JWS and JWE depend on certificates for proof of non-repudiation and confidentiality.\n\n\n5.1.1 Reasons Not to Use a Public CA\n\nA public CA can revoke the intermediate certificate used for signing our certificates, thus effectively shutting down all communication between platforms.\n\nA public CA also signs certificates which are not part of the Open API for FSP Interoperability setup. Because you trust the certificate the CA signed for you, you then trust all certificates signed by that CA.\n\nThere is no service in the Open API for FSP Interoperability setup that is open to the public, so there is no reason to have a public CA already trusted by public clients (such as web browsers).\n\n\n5.1.2 Private CA Options\n\nBuild your own CA from scratch\n\nBuild a CA using existing tools (for example, openssl)\n\nUse a full-featured CA (for example, the open source product EJBCA)\n\n\n5.2 Trusted Certificate Chain\nA centralized CA makes certificate management easier for the involved platforms. By trusting the same CA certificate, each platform need only trust one certificate; the CA’s self-signed root certificate.\nThus, the CA should sign all types of certificates (TLS, signature, and encryption), but only for the participants in the Open API for FSP Interoperability setup.\nNo intermediate CA certificates are required, because a segmented layout is not used in the Open API for FSP Interoperability setup.\n5.3 CA Root Certificate\n\nThe CA must create a self-signed root certificate to be used for signing all supported types of certificates (TLS, signing, and encryption).\n\nThe minimum key length of the asymmetric RSA key pair is 4096 bits, and the signature algorithm should be sha512WithRSAEncryption.\n\nThe X.509 Basic Constraints must have the attribute CA set to TRUE.\n\nThe time validity of the CA root certificate should be ten years. After eight years, a new self-signed root certificate should be created by the CA; the asymmetric RSA key pair must be recreated, not reused. This certificate becomes the certificate to use for signing the platforms CSRs. However, the old CA root certificate must still be active until it expires. This gives the platforms a window of two years to change the CA root certificate without disturbing their ongoing secured communication.\n\n\n5.4 Signing Platforms CSRs\nThe CA must provide a mechanism for the platforms to get their CSRs signed. Common signing methods are by email and by a web page. The chosen solution and policy must be known to the platforms.\nThe CA signs three types of platform certificates; TLS (for communication), JWS (for signature) and JWE (for encryption). Common requirements for these certificates are:\n\nThe minimum key length of the asymmetric RSA key pair is 2048 bits, and the signature algorithm should be sha256WithRSAEncryption.\n\nThe X.509 Basic Constraints must have the attribute CA set to FALSE.\n\nThe subject distinguished names must contain at least the following attributes:\n\nCommon Name (CN) – This must be the hostname of the platform which has created the certificate. A N can never be the same for two different platforms or organizations.\n\nOrganization (O) – The name of the organization.\n\nCountry (C) – The country of the organization.\n\n\n\nThe URL for platforms to download CRLs must be present.\n\nThe URL for platforms to send OCSP requests must be present.\n\nThe time validity should be two years.\n\n\nDepending on the type of certificate to sign, the X.509 Key Usage and X.509 Extended Key Usage of the platform’s certificate will differ; see Table 1 for more information.\n\n\n\nCertificate Type\nX.509 Key Usage\nX.509 Extended Key Usage\n\n\n\n\nTLS Certificates\nDigital Signature, Key Encipherment\nTLS Web Server Authentication, TLS Web Client Authentication\n\n\nSignature Certificates\nDigital Signature\n\n\n\nEncryption Certificates\nKey Encipherment\n\n\n\nTable 1 – Certificate type and key usage\n5.5 Revoking Certificates\n\nThe CA must be able to revoke a platform’s certificates. Revoking a certificate means that it will no longer be trusted by any party. It will be marked as invalid by the CA and its revocation status published to the platforms, either in a revocation list (CRL) to be downloaded by platforms, or through a real-time HTTP query using Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requested by platforms.\n\nThe CA should support both CRL downloads and OCSP queries.\n\nThe CA should update and sign the CRL daily and should provide (daily) a HTTP URL to the platforms that points to the CRL to be downloaded. The URL should be stored in the CRL Distribution Points for each signed certificate.\n\nThe OCSP URL should be stored in the Authority Information Access for each signed certificate. An OCSP response must be signed. Nonce values in an OCSP request should be supported to prevent reply attacks.\n\nThe CA has the right to revoke certificates, but no obligation to inform the platforms about such revocations. The platforms do not have the right to revoke certificates, but they do have an obligation to check regularly for a certificate’s revocation status.\n\n\n5.6 Certificate Enrollment and Renewal\nThe CA does not support enrollment or renewal of certificates for which an asymmetric key pair is reused. For increased security, the asymmetric key pairs must be recreated every time a certificate is enrolled or renewed through a new CSR.\n6. Platform PKI Management Strategy\nThis section describes the PKI management strategy for platforms.\n6.1 Keys, Certificates, and Stores\nA certificate provides the identity of its owner through a trusted CA that has signed the certificate. This can be validated through its signed certificate chain. It also provides the technical means to ensure integrity (signature) and confidentiality (encryption) of data using its asymmetric key pair (known as a public key and private key). The public key is within the signed certificate, but its corresponding private key must be kept private and protected. A common solution for handling certificates and private keys is to put them into a protected storage area known as a store. A store can be a file, directory, or something else that provides access and confidentiality.\nA single private key and its associated certificate can be used for all cryptographic purposes, but to enhance security, the following set of keys and certificates is required for each platform:\n\nOne private key and certificate for TLS communication\n\nOne private key and certificate for end-to-end integrity using JWS\n\nOne private key and certificate for end-to-end confidentiality using JWE\n\n\nDifferent keys and types of certificates can all be in the same store, but a more common setup is the following:\n\nFor TLS communication:\n\nOne protected key store to hold the private key, its associated certificate, and certificate chain. These items are used for server- and client authentication in TLS.\n\nOne protected certificate store to hold all trusted TLS certificates. These certificates will be trusted by your platform during a TLS handshake, meaning that they will allow secure communication with the owners of the certificates. Since all participants trust the same CA, it is sufficient to keep only the CA’s root certificate here.\n\n\n\nFor signature and encryption:\n\nOne protected key store to hold your private keys, their associated certificates, and certificate chains used for signatures and encryption.\n\nOne private key and certificate chain used for signing using JWS, and one private key and certificate chain used for encryption using JWE.\n\nOne protected certificate store to hold all trusted signature and encryption certificates from other platforms. Here you must store the certificates (signature and encryption certificates) for each platform that you want to trust for end-to-end integrity and confidentiality.\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Creating a CSR and Obtaining CA Signature\nTo be able to communicate with other platforms, you must create a key store (if one does not already exist), an asymmetric key pair, and an associated certificate that identifies your platform. This unsigned certificate must be signed by the CA before it can be trusted by other platforms. The procedure of getting a certificate signed by a CA begins with a CSR (Certificate Signing Request).\nWhen you create your keys, certificates, and CSRs, the following requirements apply:\n\nThe minimum key length of the asymmetric RSA key pair is 2048 bits, and the signature algorithm is sha256WithRSAEncryption.\n\nThe following attributes in the subject distinguished names are mandatory:\n\nCommon Name (CN) – This must be the hostname of the platform who created the certificate. A CN can never be the same for two different platforms or organizations.\n\nOrganization (O) – The name of the organization.\n\nCountry (C) – The country of the organization.\n\n\n\n\nFor examples of how to create a store, certificate, and CSR, see Appendix C – Common PKI Tasks\nHow to create a store, certificate, and CSR.\nCreate your CSR and send it to your CA according to their instructions.\nNote: The same procedure must be performed for all your different keys and certificates (TLS, signature, and encryption).\n6.3 Importing a Signed CSR\nAfter signing your CSR, you will have two certificates in your response from the CA. The first certificate is your own signed certificate. The second is the CA’s own root certificate, which was used for signing your certificate. That certificate must now be trusted by you.\nFirst you must import your signed certificate into your key store. It must replace your unsigned certificate. For examples, see How to import a signed certificate into your key store.\nThen you must import the CA’s root certificate into the same key store to complete the chain between your certificate and the CA. For examples, see How to import the CA certificate into your key store.\n6.3.1 TLS Certificates\nFor TLS certificates, you must also import the CA’s root certificate into your TLS trust store to automatically trust the other platforms when establishing new communication channels with them. For examples, see How to import the CA certificate into TLS trust store.\nThe above procedure should be performed for each of your signed CSRs. Remember to send your signed certificate and the CA’s root certificate to all other platforms with which you need to communicate.\nThe CA will create a validity period of two years for your signed certificate. After 18 months, you should create a new CSR to be signed by the same CA. Your newly signed certificate and the CA’s root certificate should once again be imported into your stores and sent to the other platforms. This will give you and your peers a window of six months to make sure that your new signed certificate works. After two years, the old expired certificate can be deleted.\n6.4 Trusting Certificates from Other Platforms\nJust as your peers must have your certificates to be able to trust you, they must send their certificates to you for you to trust them.\nMake sure that you always receive at least two certificates from a trusted peer:\n\nThe signed certificate of the peer to trust.\n\nThe root certificate of the CA that signed the peer’s certificate.\n\n\nNote: A peer’s CA certificate can differ from yours. This can happen if the CA has created a new CA root certificate when the old one is about to expire.\nYou should always view a peer’s certificates (check CN, validity period, and so on) and validate the certificate chain (that is, that each certificate is correctly signed by the given CA) before you import them into your trust store.\nFor examples, see How to view a certificate.\nNext, import the peer’s certificate and its CA root certificate into your trust store. For examples, see How to import a trusted certificate.\n6.5 Checking Certificate Revocation Status\nCertificates can be revoked by the CA. A revoked certificate is considered not trusted and should be removed from the trust store. A certificate can also be on hold, which means that it is in pending state due to investigation and should not be removed.\nAll platforms should perform revocation checks on a regular basis. There are two common ways to find out which certificates have been revoked; either through viewing a revocation list (CRL) to be downloaded by platforms, or through a real-time HTTP query (OCSP) requested by platforms.\n6.5.1 Certificate Revocation List\nThis is a file maintained by a CA. It contains a list of certificate serial numbers that have been revoked by the CA. This file can be downloaded by any platform at any time. The URL to the CRL file to be downloaded is included in the certificate itself and can be found in CRL Distribution Points. A CRL is signed by the CA and should be validated.\nA CRL should be downloaded once per day and cached by the platform.\nFor examples, see How to verify a certificate through a CRL.\n6.5.2 Online Certificate Status Protocol\nThe status of a certificate can be retrieved by sending an OCSP request to an OCSP Responder (which can be the CA). The request contains the serial number of the certificate to be checked. The responder sends back a signed response including the status of the certificate.\nThe request should contain a nonce value, which the responder will put in the response, for the platform to validate on receipt. This is to prevent reply attacks.\nAn OCSP request/response is considered very fast and can be executed for each received client certificate operation, but depending on the load towards the responder, it might have to be cached by the platform as well.\nThe OCSP URL is included in the certificate itself and can be found in Authority Information Access.\nFor examples, see How to verify a certificate through an OCSP request.\n6.6 Renewing Certificates\nDo not renew certificates for which an asymmetric key pair is reused. For increased security, the asymmetric key pairs must be recreated every time through a new CSR.\n7. Transport Layer Protection\nThis section describes transport layer protection.\n7.1 TLS\nTLS provides point-to-point integrity and confidentiality, and is used for all communication between peers.\nThe setup requires both server authentication - meaning that the server presents itself through its own TLS certificate - and client authentication (also known as mutual authentication) in which the client presents itself through its own TLS certificate.\n7.1.1 TLS Protocol Versions\nThe TLS protocol version used must be 1.2 or higher.\n7.1.2 TLS Cipher Suites\nThe following cipher suites should be used:\n\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\n\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\n\nTLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\n\nTLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\n\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\n\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\n\n\n8. Application Layer Protection\nThis section describes the application layer protection.\n8.1 JSON Web Signature\nThe JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard is used for providing end-to-end integrity and non-repudiation; that is, to guarantee that the sender is who it claims to be, and that the message was not tampered with.\nThe use of JWS is mandatory and certificates should be used. For more information, see API Signature.\n8.2 JSON Web Encryption\nThe JSON Web Encryption (JWE) standard is used for providing end-to-end confidentiality; that is, to protect data from being read by unauthorized parties.\nThe use of JWE is optional and is applied to specific fields. This is to fulfill regulatory requirements that might exist for certain type of data in certain countries.\nFor more information about how to apply JWE to fields in messages, see the extended JWE standard specification API Encryption.\nAppendix A Key Lengths and Algorithms\nTable 2 contains the required key length and algorithm for each entity.\n\n\n\nEntity\nAlgorithm\nKey length/hash size\n\n\n\n\nCA asymmetric keys\nRSA\n4096 bits\n\n\nCA signing algorithm\nRSA with SHA2\n>= 256 bits\n\n\nTLS asymmetric keys\nRSA\n2048 bits\n\n\nTLS signing algorithm\nRSA with SHA2\n>= 256 bits\n\n\nSignature asymmetric keys\nRSA\n2048 bits\n\n\nSignature algorithm\nRSA with SHA2\n>= 256 bits\n\n\nEncryption asymmetric keys\nRSA\n2048 bits\n\n\nHMAC\nSHA2 - AES\n>= 256 bits\n\n\nSymmetric keys\nAES\n256 bits\n\n\nHashing\nSHA2\n>= 256 bits\n\n\n\nTable 2 – Key lengths and algorithms\nAppendix B Terminology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPKI\nPublic Key Infrastructure\n\n\nAPI\nApplication Program Interface\n\n\nTLS\nTransport Layer Security\n\n\nJWS\nJSON Web Signature\n\n\nJWE\nJSON Web Encryption\n\n\nFSP\nFinancial Service Provider\n\n\nAL\nAccount Lookup\n\n\nCA\nCertificate Authority\n\n\nCSR\nCertificate Signing Request\n\n\nCRL\nCertificate Revocation List\n\n\nOCSP\nOnline Certificate Status Protocol\n\n\nPEM\nPrivacy Enhanced Mail\n\n\nRSA\nRivest, Shamir, & Adleman\n\n\nHMA\nHashed Message Authentication Code\n\n\nAES\nAdvanced Encryption Standard\n\n\nSHA\nSecure Hash Algorithm\n\n\n\nAppendix C Common PKI Tasks\nAppendix C.1 How to create a store, certificate, and CSR\nUsing the Java keytool\nUse the following command to create an asymmetric RSA key pair and associated certificate information to be signed by the\nCA. It will automatically create a JKS key store if the given one does not exist:\nkeytool -genkey -dname \"CN=\" -alias  -keyalg RSA -\nkeystore  -keysize 2048\nExample\nkeytool -genkey -dname \"CN=bank-fsp\" -alias tlscert -keyalg RSA -keystore\ntlskeystore.jks -keysize 2048\nNotes:\n\nThe certificate attribute CN specifies the hostname of the host who identifies itself using this certificate during a TLS session.\nWhen asked for password, use the same password for the key as the key store.\n\nUse the following command to create the actual CSR to be signed by the CA:\nkeytool -certreq -alias  -keystore  –file .csr\nExample\nkeytool -certreq -alias tlscert -keystore tlskeystore.jks -file tlscert.csr\nUsing openssl\nUse the following command to create an asymmetric RSA key pair, and CSR to be signed by the CA:\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -subj \"/CN=\" -out\n.csr -keyout .key\nExample\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -subj \"/CN=bank-fsp\" -out tlscert.csr -\nkeyout tlscert.key\nNote: The certificate attribute CN specifies the hostname of the host who identifies itself using this certificate during a TLS session.\nImportant to note is that the created private key is stored unencrypted. Use the following command to encrypt it:\nopenssl rsa -aes256 -in  -out \nExample\nopenssl rsa -aes256 -in tlscert.key -out tlscert_encrypted.key\nAppendix C.2 How to import a signed certificate into your key store\nUsing the Java keytool\nImport your signed certificate into your key store.

Introduction\nThis document details the security methods to be implemented for Open API for FSP Interoperability (hereafter cited as the API) to ensure integrity and non-repudiation between the API client and the API server.\nIn information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle. For the API, data integrity means that an API message cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner by parties involved in the API communication.\nIn legal terms, non-repudiation means that a person intends to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also means that one party in a transaction cannot deny having received the transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent the transaction. For the API, non-repudiation means that an API client cannot deny having sent an API message to a counterparty. JSON Web Signature (JWS), as defined in RFC 75152, must be applied to the API to provide message integrity and non-repudiation for either component fields of an API payload or the full API payload. Whenever an API client sends an API message to a counterparty, the API client should sign the message using its private key. After the counterparty receives the API message, the counterparty must validate the signature with the API client’s public key. Only the HTTP request message of an API message need to be signed, any HTTP response message of the APIs SHALL NOT be signed.\nNote: The corresponding public key should either be shared in advance with the counterparty or retrieved by the counterparty (for example, the local scheme Certificate Authority).\nBecause intermediary fees are not supported in the current version of the API, intermediaries involved in API message-transit may not modify the API message payload. Thus, the signature at full payload level is used to protect the integrity of the full payload of an API message from end-to-end. Regardless of how many intermediaries there are in transit, the original payload cannot be modified by the intermediaries. The final recipient of the API message must validate the signature generated by the original API client based on the message payload received.\nNote: Whether the signature needs to be validated by the intermediaries in transit is determined by the internal implementation of each intermediary or the local schema.\nNote: In a future version of the API, intermediary fees may be supported; at that time, signature-at-field-level may also be supported. However, both features are out-of-scope for the current version of the API.\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\n\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\n\nUse Cases\n\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\n\nJSON Binding Rules\n\nScheme Rules\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\n\nSignature\n\nEncryption\n\n\n3. API Signature Definition\nThis section introduces the technology used by the API signature, including the data exchange format for the signature of an API message and the mechanism used to generate and verify a signature.\n3.1 Signature Data Model\nThe API uses a customized HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Signature to represent the signature that is produced by the initiating API client for the API message. The data model for this parameter is described in Table 1.\nNote: Currently the API does not support intermediaries in an API message; only the message-initiator can sign a message. If this is required in the future, there will be new customized HTTP header parameter, but this is out-of-scope for the current version of the API.\nTable 1\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nprotectedHeader\n1\nString(1..32768)\nThis element indicates the HTTP header parameters that are protected by the signature. Its value must be BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)). According to JWS specification, the alg header parameter must be present to identify the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWS. A customized parameter FSPIOP-URI that represents the URI path and query parameters of HTTP request message of the APIs must be present. A customized parameter FSPIOP-HTTP-Method that holds the HTTP method used in the HTTP message must be present. A customized parameter FSPIOP-Source that represents the system which sent the API request must be present. The customized HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Destination is mandatory in protectedHeader if it is present in the HTTP header of the request.\n\n\nsignature\n1\nString(1..512)\nThis element indicates the signature. Its value is part of JWS serialization; that is, BASE64URL(JWS Signature).\n\n\n\nTable 1 – Data model of HTTP header field FSPIOP-Signature\n3.2 Generating a Signature\nTo create the signature for an API message, the following steps are performed. The order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.\n\nCreate the content to be used as the JWS Payload. Because the signature is currently at full payload level, the full HTTP body of the API message is the JWS Payload.\n\nCompute the encoded payload value BASE64URL(JWS Payload).\n\nCreate the JSON object or objects containing the desired JWS Protected Header.\n A. The alg JWS Protected Header parameter must be present. In the API, the available algorithms for the signature are RS256, RS384, RS512. A key of size 2048 bits or larger must be used with these algorithms.\n B. Other parameters registered in the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters3 are optional.\n C. The customized parameter FSPIOP-URI must be included in JWS Protected Header to protect the URI path and query parameters of the APIs.\n D. The customized parameter FSPIOP-HTTP-Method must be included in JWS Protected Header to protect the HTTP request operation method.\n E. The parameter FSPIOP-Source must be present, and its value comes from the corresponding HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Source.\n F. The parameter FSPIOP-Destination must be present if it is present in the HTTP header of the request, and its value comes from the corresponding HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Destination.\n G. Other HTTP Header parameters of the APIs are recommended to be included in JWS Protected Header, but they are optional in this JWS Protected Header.\n\nCompute the encoded header value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)).\n\nCompute the JWS Signature according to the JWS specification using the output of Step 2 and Step 4.\n\nCompute the encoded signature value BASE64URL(JWS Signature).\n\nCompute the value for the HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Signature as described in Section 3.1. The value for this FSPIOP-Signature is a JSON Object Serialization string.\n\n\nNote: If JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is used to encrypt some fields of the payload (for more information, see Encryption), then the API client should first encrypt the desired fields, then replace the plain text of those fields with the encoded cipher text in the payload, and then finally sign the payload.\n3.3 Validating Signature\nWhen validating the signature of an API request, the following steps are performed. The order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps. If any of the listed steps fails, then the signature cannot be validated.\n\nParse the HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Signature to get the components protectedHeader and signature.\n\nUse BASE64URL to decode the encoded representation of the JWS Protected Header. Verify that the resulting octet sequence is a UTF-8-encoded representation of a completely valid JSON object conforming to JSON Data Interchange Format, defined in RFC 71594.\n\nVerify the parameters in the JWS Protected Header.\n a) The parameter alg must be present and its value must be one of RS256, RS384, RS512.\n b) Other parameters registered in the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters are optional.\n c) The parameter FSPIOP-URI must be present and Its value must be the same as the input URL value of the request.\n d) The parameter FSPIOP-HTTP-Method must be present and its value must be same as the operation method of the request.\n e) The parameter FSPIOP-Source must be present, and its value must be the same as the corresponding HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Source.\n f) The parameter FSPIOP-Destination must be present if it is present in the HTTP header of the request, and its value must be same as the corresponding HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Destination.\n g) If there are other HTTP header parameters present in JWS Protected Header, then their values must be validated with the corresponding HTTP header values.\n\nCompute the encoded payload value BASE64URL(JWS Payload). Because the current signature is at full payload level, the full HTTP body of the API message is the JWS Payload.\n\nValidate the JWS Signature against the JWS Signing Input ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWS Payload)) in the manner defined for the algorithm being used, which must be accurately represented by the value of the alg (algorithm) Header Parameter.\n\nRecord whether the validation succeeded.\n\n\n4. API Signature Examples\nThis section uses a typical quote process to explain how the API signature is implemented using JWS.

Introduction\nThis document details security methods to be implemented for Open API (Application Programming Interface) for FSP (Financial Service Provider) Interoperability (hereafter cited as \"the API\") to ensure confidentiality of API messages between an API client and the API\nserver.\nIn information security, confidentiality means that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes (excerpt from ISO27000The ISO 27000 Directory). For the API, confidentiality means that some sensitive fields in the payload of an API message cannot be accessed or identified in an unauthorized or undetected manner by the intermediaries involved in the API communication. That is, if some fields of an API message are encrypted by the API client, then only the expected API recipient can decrypt those fields.\nJSON Web Encryption (JWE, defined in RFC 7516JSON Web Encryption (JWE)) must be applied to the API to provide end to end message confidentiality. When an API client sends an HTTP request (such as an API request or callback message) to a counterparty, the API client can determine whether there are sensitive fields in the API message to be protected according to the regulation or local schema. If there is a field to be protected, then the API client uses JWE to encrypt the value of that field. Subsequently, the cipher text of that field will be transmitted to the counterparty.\nTo support encryption for multiple fields of an API message, JWE is extended in this document to adapt to the requirements of the API.\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\n\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\n\nUse Cases\n\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\n\nJSON Binding Rules\n\nScheme Rules\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\n\nSignature\n\nEncryption\n\n\n3. API Encryption Definition\nThis section introduces the technology used by API encryption, including:\n\nData exchange format for the encrypted fields of an API message.\n\nMechanism for encrypting and decrypting fields.\n\n\n3.1 Encryption Data Model\nThe API uses the customized HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption to represent the encrypted fields of an API message; its value is a JSON object serialization. The data model of this parameter is described in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3.\nNote: If FSPIOP-Encryption is present in an API message, then it must also be protected by the API signature. That means FSPIOP-Encryption must be included in the JWS Protected Header of the signature.\nTable 1\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nencryptedFields\n1\nEncryptedFields\nInformation about the encrypted fields of an API message\n\n\n\nTable 1 -- Data model of HTTP Header Field FSPIOP-Encryption\nTable 2\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nencryptedField\n1..*\nEncryptedField\nInformation about the encrypted field of an API message\n\n\n\nTable 2 -- Data model of complex type EncryptedFields\nTable 3\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfieldName\n1\nString(1..512)\nThis element identifies the field to be encrypted in the payload of an API message. Because the API payload is a JSON Object serialization string, the field name must be able to identify the exact element path in the JSON Object. A single period ('.') character is used to separate the elements in an element path. For example, payer.personalInfo.dateOfBirth is a valid value for this element for the API request POST /quotes.\n\n\nencryptedKey\n1\nString(1..512)\nEncrypted Content Encryption Key (CEK) value. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key). If there are multiple fields of the API message to be encrypted, we recommend that the same JWE Encrypted Key be used to simplify the implementation; however, this is a decision to be made by each FSP internally based on their implementation.\n\n\nprotectedHeader\n1\nString(1..1024)\nThis element identifies the Header Parameters that are applied to JWE to encrypt the specified field. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)). For example, if the JWE Protected Header applied to the encryption is {\"alg\":\"RSA-OAEP- 256\",\"enc\":\"A256GCM\"}, then the value is eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ.\n\n\ninitializationVector\n1\nString(1..128)\nInitialization Vector value used when encrypting the plaintext. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector).\n\n\nauthenticationTag\n1\nString(1..128)\nAuthentication Tag value resulting from authenticated encryption of the plaintext with Additional Authenticated Data. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag)\n\n\n\nTable 3 -- Data model of complex type EncryptedField\n3.2 Encrypt Fields of API Message\nThis section describes the encryption process for message fields. The order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.\n\nDetermine the algorithm used to determine the CEK value (this is the algorithm recorded in the alg (algorithm) Header Parameter of the resulting JWE). Because the CEK should be encrypted with the public key of the API recipient, in the API the available algorithms to protect the CEK can only be RSA-OAEP-256. \nIf there are multiple fields to be encrypted in the API message, then perform Steps 3-15 for each field. \nGenerate a random CEK. The FSP can generate the value using either its own application or using the JWE implementation employed. \nEncrypt the CEK with the algorithm determined by the JWE header parameter alg. \nCompute the encoded key value BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key). \nGenerate a random JWE Initialization Vector of the correct size for the content encryption algorithm (if required for the algorithm); otherwise, let the JWE Initialization Vector be the empty octet sequence. \nCompute the encoded Initialization Vector value BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector). \nIf a zip parameter was included, compress the plaintext using the specified compression algorithm and let M be the octet sequence representing the compressed plain text; otherwise, let M be the octet sequence representing the plain text. \nCreate the JSON object or objects containing the desired set of header parameters, which together comprise the JWE Protected Header. Besides the parameter alg, the parameter enc must be included in the JWE Protected Header. The available values for the parameter enc in the API can only be: A128GCM, A192GCM, A256GCM. A256GCM is recommended. \nCompute the Encoded Protected Header value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)). \nLet the Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter be ASCII(Encoded Protected Header). \nEncrypt M using the CEK, the JWE Initialization Vector, and the Additional Authenticated Data value using the specified content encryption algorithm to create the JWE Cipher text value and the JWE Authentication Tag (which is the Authentication Tag output from the encryption operation). \nCompute the encoded cipher text value BASE64URL(JWE Cipher Text). \nCompute the encoded Authentication Tag value BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag). \nCompute the encryptedField element (see Table 3) for the HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption. \nCompute the value for the HTTP Header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption as described in Section 2.1. The value for this FSPIOP-Encryption is JSON Object Serialization string.\n\nNote: If JWE is used to encrypt some fields of the payload, then the API client should:\n\nEncrypt the desired fields.\n\nReplace those fields' value with the encoded cipher text in the payload.\n\nSign the payload.\n\n\n3.3 Decrypt Fields of API Message\nIf the HTTP Header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption (which is also protected by the API signature) is present, then the API message recipient should decrypt the encrypted fields of the API message after the API signature is validated successfully. The message decryption process is the reverse of the encryption process. The order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps. If there are multiple fields being encrypted, then all fields must be decrypted successfully; otherwise it indicates the API message is invalid.\n\nParse the HTTP Header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption to get encrypted fields' information, including field name, JWE Protected Header, JWE Encrypted Key, JWE Initialization Vector, and JWE Authentication Tag for each field. If there are multiple fields being encrypted, then perform Steps 2-9 for each encrypted field.\nGet the cipher text of the encrypted field by parsing the payload with the specified field path. The value of the specified field is already encoded with BASE64URL. \nVerify that the octet sequence resulting from decoding the encoded JWE Protected Header is a UTF-8-encoded representation of a valid JSON object conforming to JSON Data Interchange Format (defined in RFC 7159The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format); let the JWE Protected Header be this JSON object. \nVerify that the parameters in the JWE Protected Header understand and can process all fields that are required to support the JWE specification; for example, the algorithm being used.\nDetermine that the algorithm specified by the alg (algorithm) Header Parameter matches the algorithm of the public / private key of the API recipient. \nDecrypt the JWE Encrypted Key with the private key of the API recipient to get the JWE CEK. \nLet the Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter be ASCII(Encoded Protected Header). \nDecrypt the JWE Cipher Text using the CEK, the JWE Initialization Vector, the Additional Authenticated Data value, and the JWE Authentication Tag (which is the Authentication Tag input to the calculation) using the specified content encryption algorithm, returning the decrypted plaintext and validating the JWE Authentication Tag in the manner specified for the algorithm. If the JWE Authentication Tag is incorrect, then reject the input without any decryption. \nIf a zip parameter was included, then the API recipient should decompress the decrypted plaintext using the specified compression algorithm. \n\n4. API Encryption/Decryption Examples\nThis section uses a typical quote process to explain how the API encryption and decryption are implemented using JWE. As the algorithm of public / private key of the API recipient can only be RSA, the RSA key used for this example is represented in JSON Web Key (JWK, defined in RFC 7517JSON Web Key(JWK)) format below (with line breaks and indentation within values for display purposes only):\n{\n    \"kty\": \"RSA\",\n    \"n\": \"oahUIoWw0K0usKNuOR6H4wkf4oBUXHTxRvgb48E-\n        BVvxkeDNjbC4he8rUWcJoZmds2h7M70imEVhRU5djINXtqllXI4DFqcI1DgjT9Le\n        wND8MW2Krf3Spsk_ZkoFnilakGygTwpZ3uesH-\n        PFABNIUYpOiN15dsQRkgr0vEhxN92i2asbOenSZeyaxziK72UwxrrKoExv6kc5tw\n        XTq4h-QChLOln0_mtUZwfsRaMStPs6mS6XrgxnxbWhojf663tuEQueGC-\n        FCMfra36C9knDFGzKsNa7LZK2djYgyD3JR_MB_4NUJW_TqOQtwHYbxevoJArm-\n        L5StowjzGy-_bq6Gw\",\n    \"e\": \"AQAB\",\n    \"d\": \"kLdtIj6GbDks_ApCSTYQtelcNttlKiOyPzMrXHeI-yk1F7-kpDxY4-\n        WY5NWV5KntaEeXS1j82E375xxhWMHXyvjYecPT9fpwR_M9gV8n9Hrh2anTpTD93D\n        t62ypW3yDsJzBnTnrYu1iwWRgBKrEYY46qAZIrA2xAwnm2X7uGR1hghkqDp0Vqj3\n        kbSCz1XyfCs6_LehBwtxHIyh8Ripy40p24moOAbgxVw3rxT_vlt3UVe4WO3JkJOz\n        lpUf-KTVI2Ptgm-dARxTEtE-id-4OJr0h-K-\n        VFs3VSndVTIznSxfyrj8ILL6MG_Uv8YAu7VILSB3lOW085-4qE3DzgrTjgyQ\",\n    \"p\": \"1r52Xk46c-LsfB5P442p7atdPUrxQSy4mti_tZI3Mgf2EuFVbUoDBvaRQ-\n        SWxkbk-\n        moEzL7JXroSBjSrK3YIQgYdMgyAEPTPjXv_hI2_1eTSPVZfzL0lffNn03IXqWF5M\n        DFuoUYE0hzb2vhrlN_rKrbfDIwUbTrjjgieRbwC6Cl0\",\n    \"q\":\n        \"wLb35x7hmQWZsWJmB_vle87ihgZ19S8lBEROLIsZG4ayZVe9Hi9gDVCOBmUDdaD\n        YVTSNx_8Fyw1YYa9XGrGnDew00J28cRUoeBB_jKI1oma0Orv1T9aXIWxKwd4gvxF\n        ImOWr3QRL9KEBRzk2RatUBnmDZJTIAfwTs0g68UZHvtc\",\n    \"dp\": \"ZK-\n        YwE7diUh0qR1tR7w8WHtolDx3MZ_OTowiFvgfeQ3SiresXjm9gZ5KLhMXvo-uz-\n        KUJWDxS5pFQ_M0evdo1dKiRTjVw_x4NyqyXPM5nULPkcpU827rnpZzAJKpdhWAgq\n        rXGKAECQH0Xt4taznjnd_zVpAmZZq60WPMBMfKcuE\",\n    \"dq\":\n        \"Dq0gfgJ1DdFGXiLvQEZnuKEN0UUmsJBxkjydc3j4ZYdBiMRAy86x0vHCjywcMlY\n        Yg4yoC4YZa9hNVcsjqA3FeiL19rk8g6Qn29Tt0cj8qqyFpz9vNDBUfCAiJVeESOj\n        JDZPYHdHY8v1b-o-Z2X5tvLx-TCekf7oxyeKDUqKWjis\",\n    \"qi\": \"VIMpMYbPf47dT1w_zDUXfPimsSegnMOA1zTaX7aGk_8urY6R8-\n        ZW1FxU7AlWAyLWybqq6t16VFd7hQd0y6flUK4SlOydB61gwanOsXGOAOv82cHq0E\n        3eL4HrtZkUuKvnPrMnsUUFlfUdybVzxyjz9JF_XyaY14ardLSjf4L_FNY\"\n}\n\n4.1 Encryption Example\nThe following message text is an example of POST /quotes without encryption sent by Payer FSP to a Payee FSP.\nPOST /quotes HTTP/1.1 \nFSPIOP-Destination:5678\nAccept:application/vnd.interoperability.quotes+json;version=1.0 \nContent-Length:975 \nDate:Tue, 23 May 2017 21:12:31 GMT \nFSPIOP-Source:1234 \nContent-Type:application/vnd.interoperability.quotes+json;version=1.0\n\n{\n    \"payee\": {\n        \"partyIdInfo\": { \"partyIdType\": \"MSISDN\", \"partyIdentifier\": \"15295558888\",\n            \"fspId\": \"5678\" } },\n    \"amountType\": \"RECEIVE\",\n    \"transactionType\": { \"scenario\": \"TRANSFER\", \"initiator\": \"PAYER\",\n        \"subScenario\": \"P2P Transfer across MM systems\", \"initiatorType\": \"CONSUMER\" },\n    \"note\": \"this is a sample for POST /quotes\",\n    \"amount\": { \"amount\": \"150\",\"currency\": \"USD\" },\n    \"fees\": { \"amount\": \"1.5\", \"currency\": \"USD\" },\n    \"extensionList\": [\n        { \"value\": \"value1\", \"key\": \"key1\"},\n        { \"value\": \"value2\", \"key\": \"key2\"},\n        { \"value\": \"value3\", \"key\": \"key3\" }\n    ],\n    \"geoCode\": { \"latitude\": \"57.323889\", \"longitude\": \"125.520001\"\n    },\n    \"expiration\": \"2017-05-24T08:40:00.000-04:00\",\n    \"payer\": {\n        \"personalInfo\": {\n            \"complexName\": { \"firstName\": \"Bill\", \"middleName\": \"Ben\", \"LastName\": \"Lee\"\n            }, \"dateOfBirth\": \"1986-02-14\" },\n        \"partyIdInfo\": { \"partyIdType\": \"MSISDN\",\n            \"partySubIdOrType\": \"RegisteredCustomer\", \"partyIdentifier\": \"16135551212\",\n            \"fspId\": \"1234\"\n        }, \"name\": \"Bill Lee\"\n    }, \"quoteId\": \"59e331fa-345f-4554-aac8-fcd8833f7d50\",\n    \"transactionId\": \"36629a51-393a-4e3c-b347-c2cb57e1e1fc\"\n}\n\nIn this case, the Payer FSP would like to encrypt two fields of the API message: payer and payee.partyIdInfo.partyIdentifier.\n4.1.1 Encrypt the Required Fields\nBecause there are two fields to be encrypted, the Payer FSP needs to encrypt the two fields one-by-one.\n4.1.1.1 Encrypt \"payer\"\nThe Payer FSP performs the following steps to encrypt the field payer in the POST /quotes API message.\n\nDetermine the algorithm used to determine the CEK value.

The FSP then parses the HTTP Header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption to get encrypted fields information, including field name, JWE Protected Header, JWE Encrypted Key, JWE Initialization Vector, and JWE Authentication Tag for each field.\n4.2.2 Decrypt the Encrypted Fields\nIn this case, the Payee FSP gets two fields payer and payee.partyIdInfo.partyIdentifier from the HTTP header FSPIOP- Encryption. Then the Payee FSP decrypts the two fields one-by-one.\n4.2.2.1 Decrypt payer\nThe Payer FSP performs the following steps to decrypt the field payer in the POST /quotes API message.\n\nGet the encoded BASE64RUL(JWE Protected Header) from the parsed FSPIOP-Encryption for the field payer.
