    Version
    1.1](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-specification/blob/main/documents/v1.1-document-set/API%20Definition_v1.1.pdf).

    This is implementation friendly version of the API definition.

    It includes the below definitions needed for third-party functionality. -
    AuthenticationType
      - U2F enum
    - AuthenticationValue
      - oneOf is changed to anyOf
      - new element is added U2FPinValue
    - New element U2FPIN

    **Note:** The API supports a maximum size of 65536 bytes (64 Kilobytes) in
    the HTTP header.

        The HTTP request `POST /participants/{Type}/{ID}` (or `POST
        /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}`) is used to create information in the
        server regarding the provided identity, defined by `{Type}`, `{ID}`, and
        optionally `{SubId}` (for example, `POST /participants/MSISDN/123456789`
        or `POST /participants/BUSINESS/shoecompany/employee1`). An
        ExtensionList element has been added to this reqeust in version v1.1

        The HTTP request `GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}` (or `GET
        /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}`) is used to find out in which FSP the
        requested Party, defined by `{Type}`, `{ID}` and optionally `{SubId}`,
        is located (for example, `GET /participants/MSISDN/123456789`, or `GET

        support a query string for filtering of currency. To use filtering of
        currency, the HTTP request `GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ`
        should be used, where `XYZ` is the requested currency.

        The API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular
        expression to avoid characters which are generally not used in a name.


        Regular Expression - The regular expression for restricting the Name
        type is "^(?!\s*$)[\w .,'-]{1,128}$". The restriction does not allow a
        string consisting of whitespace only, all Unicode characters are
        allowed, as well as the period (.) (apostrophe (‘), dash (-), comma (,)
        and space characters ( ).


        **Note:** In some programming languages, Unicode support must be
        specifically enabled. For example, if Java is used, the flag
        UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS must be enabled to allow Unicode characters.

        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.

        - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory
        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a
        participant. The MSISDN identifier should be in international format
        according to the [ITU-T E.164
        standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en). Optionally, the
        MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
        international prefix.

        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a participant. The format of
        the email should be according to the informational [RFC
        3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).

        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a
        participant. Examples of personal identification are passport number,
        birth certificate number, and national registration number. The
        identifier number is added in the PartyIdentifier element. The personal
        identifier type is added in the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a
        company) is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier
        can be in any format. To make a transaction connected to a specific
        username or bill number in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element
        should be used.

        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to
        a specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party. For
        referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
        use the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any
        format, as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.

        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to
        a participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
        characters and should be entered without whitespace.

        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should
        be created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system. The ALIAS
        identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias
        defined by the PartyIdentifier.
