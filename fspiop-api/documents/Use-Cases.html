<h2 id="2-introduction">2. Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to define a set of use cases that can be implemented using the Open API for FSP interoperability (hereafter cited as the API). The use cases referenced within this document provide an overview of transaction processing flows and business rules of each transaction step as well as relevant error conditions.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the API is to support the movement of financial transactions between one <em>Financial Services Provider</em> (FSP) and another.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the API is only responsible for message exchange between FSPs and a Switch when a cross-FSP transaction is initiated by an <em>End User</em> in one of the FSPs. This can occur in either of two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A bilateral scenario in which FSPs communicate with each other</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Switch based scenario in which all communication goes through a Switch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reconciliation, clearing and settlement after real time transactions is out of scope for the API. Additionally, account lookup is supported by the API, but it relies on the implementation in a local market in which a third party or Switch would provide such services. Therefore, the need for effective on-boarding processes and appropriate scheme rules must be considered when implementing use cases.</p>

<p>The following generic transaction patterns are introduced in <em>Generic Transaction Patterns</em> to reduce duplication of each use case description. These patterns summarize the common transaction process flows and shared function of the relevant use cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Payer-Initiated Transaction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a <em>Payer-Initiated Transaction</em>, it is the <em>Payer</em> (that is, the payer of electronic funds) who initiates the transaction.</p>
<p>The pattern should be used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to another party whose account is not located in the same FSP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Payee-Initiated Transaction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a <em>Payee-Initiated Transaction</em>, it is the <em>Payee</em> (that is, the recipient of electronic funds) who initiates the transaction.</p>
<p>This pattern should be used whenever a Payee would like to receive funds from another party whose account is not located in the same FSP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Payee-Initiated Transaction using OTP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <em>Payee-Initiated Transaction using One-Time Password (OTP)</em> is like a <em>Payee-Initiated Transaction</em>, but the transaction information (including fees and taxes) and approval for the Payer is shown or entered on a Payee device instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This pattern should be used when a Payee would like to receive funds from another party whose account is not located in the same FSP, and both the transaction information (including fees and taxes) and approval is shown or entered on a Payee device instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bulk Transactions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a <em>Bulk Transaction</em>, it is the Payer (that is, the sender of funds) who initiates multiple transactions to multiple Payees, potentially located in different FSPs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The pattern should be used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to multiple Payees in the same transaction. The Payees can potentially be in different FSPs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to read all Generic Transaction Patterns before reading the use cases. For more information, see <em>Generic Transaction Patterns</em>.</p>
<p>Each use case describes variations on and special considerations for the generic transaction pattern to which it refers. The use cases are introduced in Table 1.</p>

<h4 id="411-use-case-description">4.1.1 Use Case Description</h4>
<p>This section describes the business process and business rules for a use case in which an individual End User initiates a transaction to send money to another individual End User who doesn&#x2019;t belong to the same FSP as the Payer.</p>
<p>This is usually a remote transaction in which Payer and Payee are not in the same location. </p>
<p>There are four steps necessary to complete a <em>P2P</em> Transfer transaction from one FSP user to another FSP user.</p>
<h5 id="4111-step-1">4.1.1.1 Step 1</h5>
<p>Payer initiates a transaction to their FSP, and Payer FSP then locates Payee FSP through an API call to the Account Lookup System or by the agreed-upon <em>scheme</em> rules.</p>
<h5 id="4112-step-2">4.1.1.2 Step 2</h5>
<p>Payer FSP calculates the transaction fee applied to Payer. Payer FSP sends a quote request through an API call to Payee FSP.</p>
<h5 id="4113-step-3">4.1.1.3 Step 3</h5>
<p>Payer FSP presents the total transaction fee and Payee name (optional) to the Payer to confirm the transaction.</p>
<h5 id="4114-step-4">4.1.1.4 Step 4</h5>
<p>Payer accepts the transaction and Payer FSP performs the transaction through an API call to the Switch or to Payee FSP. The transaction completes and notifications are sent to both Payer and Payee; or the Payer rejects the transaction and the transaction ends.</p>

<h5 id="4141-step-2">4.1.4.1 Step 2</h5>
<p>The Payee FSP ID could be determined by the scheme rule without any dependence on the API. Otherwise, <strong>Lookup Party Information</strong> request is an option for determining in which FSP a Payee is located.</p>
<p>Payer FSP will use the request <strong>Lookup Party Information</strong> to retrieve details of Payee from Payee FSP directly if there is no Switch between Payer FSP and Payee FSP.</p>
<h5 id="4142-steps-9-&#x2013;-step-15">4.1.4.2 Steps 9 &#x2013; Step 15</h5>
<p>In the current version of the API, the <strong>Calculate Quote</strong> request to Payee FSP is mandatory even if a wholesale fee is agreed upon in the scheme. Payee FSP needs to receive transaction details from the <strong>Calculate Quote</strong> request to generate the condition for this transaction.</p>
<p>Payer FSP can use information from response <strong>Return Quote Information</strong> from Payee FSP to calculate the transaction fee it will apply on Payer. The business rules for how Payer FSP calculates the transaction fee could be defined by the scheme rules; this is out of scope for the API.</p>
<p>In P2P Transfer case, it is the common practice that Payer pays the entire transaction fee, and Payee is free of charge in the transaction.</p>
<h5 id="4143-step-16">4.1.4.3 Step 16</h5>
<p>There are several ways to push a confirmation message to Payer to authorize the transaction. For example, USSD Push Message, or SMSC notification; then Payer opens the USSD menu to query and confirm the pending transaction</p>
<p>The interaction between Payer and Payer FSP is designed by each FSP, and is out-of-scope for the API.</p>
<h5 id="4144-step-19">4.1.4.4 Step 19</h5>
<p>The Quote ID applied in the previous step is verified in the transaction processing step. If the quote is expired, Payee FSP will reject the transaction.</p>
<h5 id="4145-step-20">4.1.4.5 Step 20</h5>
<p>A notification is sent to the Payee once the transaction is performed by Payee FSP.</p>
<h5 id="4146-step-28">4.1.4.6 Step 28</h5>
<p>Payer FSP sends notification to Payer to indicate the transaction result.</p>

<h4 id="441-use-case-description">4.4.1 Use Case Description</h4>
<p>This section describes the business process and business rules for the use case in which a customer requests that an agent of a different FSP cash-out (withdraw funds) from their account. In this use case, the agent initiates the transaction through a POS, and the customer inputs a OTP on POS to authorize the transaction. Alternatively, the agent can use POS to scan a QR code generated by the mobile app of the customer to initiate the transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Approval using OTP &#x2013; A Payer can approve a transaction by first creating an OTP in their FSP. The OTP is then entered in a Payee device (usually a POS device). The OTP in the transaction request is automatically matched by the Payer FSP to either approve or reject the transaction. The OTP does not need to be encrypted as it should only be valid once during a short time period.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Approval using QR code &#x2013; A Payer can approve a transaction by requesting a Payer FSP to generate a QR code that encodes an OTP and customer&#x2019;s identifier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Approval using NFC &#x2013; A Payer can approve a transaction by swiping a <em>Near Field Communication</em> (NFC) phone on a POS. The interoperability for NFC POS of one FSP to read data from NFC tag or NFC phone of another FSP should be considered if NFC technology is adopted.</p>

<p>This section describes the business process and business rules for a use case in which a registered customer initiates a transaction to withdraw cash using an agent who is in a different FSP. This is two-step business process: a customer initiates cash-out transaction on their handset and then receives transaction information including fees, which can either be rejected or accepted.</p>
<p>Customer-Initiated Cash-Out usually is a face-to-face transaction in which the customer and the agent are in the same location.</p>

<p>This section describes the business process and business rules for a use case in which a registered customer initiates a merchant payment transaction to pay a merchant who is in another FSP.</p>
<p>This could be a face to face transaction; for example, when a customer buys goods or services at the merchant store. Another case is online payment, in which an online shopping system generates a QR code and displays on the web page, and the customer then scans the QR code on the web page and authorizes and completes the payment transaction on their handset.</p>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> Encoding/Decoding QR code is handled in each FSP and is out of scope of API. The data and its format encoded in the QR code should be defined in the scheme rules to enable QR codes to be interoperable.</p>

<p>For feature phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer can initiate a payment transaction by inputting relevant payment information on the USSD menu, such as amount and merchant ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>For smart phone:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The customer initiates merchant payment transaction by scanning the merchant QR code. After resolving the merchant QR code, there are two scenarios:</p>
<p>a) The customer inputs transaction amount in their handset to continue the transaction if the transaction amount is not encoded in the QR code. This is the case for face-to-face payment at retailer merchant store.</p>
<p>b) Transaction amount has already been encoded in the QR code, and then Payer FSP has enough information to continue the transaction. This case then follows the process of the online payment case identified in <a href="#461-use-case-description">4.6.1</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="4642-step-2">4.6.4.2 Step 2</h5>
<p>The merchant FSP ID could be determined by the scheme rules without depending on an Account Lookup System. Otherwise, <strong>Lookup Party Information</strong> request is an option to find out in which FSP the merchant is located.</p>
<p>In most cases, the merchant FSP ID is captured during initiating the transaction. For example, the customer selects the merchant FSP from USSD menu, or it is already encoded in the merchant QR code.</p>
<h5 id="4643-step-9-&#x2013;-step-15">4.6.4.3 Step 9 &#x2013; Step 15</h5>
<p>In most cases, the customer is free of charge for the purchase transaction. <strong>Calculate Quote</strong> request is still necessary, because all transaction details will be sent to Payee FSP and the condition of the transfer will be generated by Payee FSP for later use (in <strong>Perform Transfer</strong>).</p>
<h5 id="4644-step-20">4.6.4.4 Step 20</h5>

<p>This use case describes a merchant payment initiated by a merchant using a device such as POS, and how to authorize a transaction with an OTP or a QR code.</p>
<p>The merchant initiates a merchant payment transaction using a POS device. This device has the capability to capture the customer&#x2019;s authorization on POS instead of the customer&#x2019;s mobile device. The authorization information captured in POS should be sent to Payer FSP to perform the authorization.</p>
<p>The business process involves two parties, Merchant and Customer. The merchant initiates a request to pay for the customer, and the customer reviews the payment request on POS and authorizes the payment by OTP or QR code on the POS itself. The customer authentication information is sent from Payee FSP to Payer FSP for authentication by Payer FSP. If authentication is successful then transaction will be posted on Payer FSP and Payee FSP.</p>

<h5 id="4841-step-1-3">4.8.4.1 Step 1-3</h5>
<p>The customer can pre-authorize the transaction by generating a dynamic payment QR code on a mobile app if they have a smart phone.</p>
<p>The customer can request an OTP on the USSD menu if they have a feature phone.</p>
<h5 id="4842-step-4">4.8.4.2 Step 4</h5>
<p>For mobile app:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The merchant uses a scan device such as a POS to capture the QR code and initiate the payment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both customer ID and OTP are encoded in the QR code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For feature phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>The merchant inputs customer&#x2019;s ID and amount to initiate the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="4843-step-20">4.8.4.3 Step 20</h5>
<p>Steps 1-3 are optional and will be used only when OTP is generated by Payer to authenticate the purchase at the merchant
device. However, it would be very rare for a customer to generate the OTP manually; instead Payer FSP would generate an OTP for the customer as described in Step 20.</p>
<h5 id="4844-step-21">4.8.4.4 Step 21</h5>
<p>There is a risk that someone other than the owner of phone may attempt to use the phone to make a transaction at agent store. Thus, the transaction should be approved via PIN to allow OTP to be generated automatically.</p>
<h5 id="4845-step-25">4.8.4.5 Step 25</h5>
<p>The customer need only confirm the transaction on POS if initiating transaction with a QR code in step 4, because OTP is encoded in the QR code and parsed in Step 4.</p>

<p>This use case involves two parties: ATM and Customer. ATM initiates a Cash-Out request from the customer account and the customer confirms the request by providing authentication (OTP) on ATM. The customer pre-generates an OTP for cash-out and uses this OTP on ATM device to initiate ATM Cash-out. The Payer FSP validates the OTP received in <em>ATM-Initiated Cash-Out</em> request for the validity of OTP as well as for authentication. If the customer authentication via OTP is successful; then the customer&#x2019;s account will be debited at Payer FSP and ATM account maintained at Payee FSP will be credited. As a result, the customer receives cash from ATM.</p>

<h5 id="4941-step-1-3">4.9.4.1 Step 1-3</h5>
<p>Steps 1 to 3 are optional; however, it is recommended that customer generate an OTP before initiating the transaction request from ATM.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a customer generates a QR code for cash-out via mobile app other than OTP.</p>
<h5 id="4942-step-4">4.9.4.2 Step 4</h5>
<p>For mobile app:</p>
<ul>
<li>ATM can scan previously-generated cash-out QR code.</li>
</ul>
<p>For feature phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer initiates withdrawal transaction by inputting their account ID and amount.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="4943-step-20">4.9.4.3 Step 20</h5>
<p>In <em>ATM-Initiated Cash-Out</em>, it is very rare that an OTP is automatically generated by a Payer FSP, because this will delay the transaction due to SMS delivery, and the ATM transaction will time out. Therefore, it is recommended that customer generate an OTP for ATM Cash-out as mentioned in Steps 1-3.</p>
<h5 id="4944-step-21">4.9.4.4 Step 21</h5>
<p>There is a risk that someone other than the owner of phone holding the handset may make a transaction at an ATM device. In this case, the transaction should be approved via PIN so that the OTP can be generated automatically.</p>
<h5 id="4945-step-25">4.9.4.5 Step 25</h5>
<p>If an OTP is used, the customer enters the OTP that was generated in Steps 1-3 or Step 21.</p>
<p>If a QR code is used to cash-out and it is captured by an ATM when initiating the transaction in Step 4, then the customer must confirm or reject the transaction on the ATM only; inputting security credentials such as OTP or password is not necessary.</p>

<h4 id="4101-use-case-description">4.10.1 Use Case Description</h4>
<p>This section describes a <em>Bulk Payments</em> use case. The use case is written from the end-user perspective to give additional information to the <em>Generic Transaction Patterns</em> document.</p>
<p>Bulk Payments are used when an organization or business is paying out funds; for example, aid or salary to multiple Payees. The organization or business can group transactions together to make it easier to upload and validate individual transactions in bulk before the bulk transaction is executed. It is also possible for the organization to follow up the result of the individual transactions in the bulk transaction after the bulk transaction is executed.</p>

<h4 id="4104-addition-to-general-pattern">4.10.4 Addition to General Pattern</h4>
<p>This section describes how the use case connects to the general pattern. The description is focused on the end-user as the interactions between the participating systems are described in the general pattern.</p>
<h5 id="41041-step-1">4.10.4.1 Step 1</h5>
<p>The Payer creates a bulk transaction according to the format of the Payer FSP. Each row in the bulk transaction includes information about a transfer between a Payer account and a Payee account. The information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A unique transaction ID for the bulk so that the Payer can follow up the status of individual transactions in the bulk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identifier of the Payee</p>
</li>
<li><p>Amount and currency to be transferred</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Payer will upload the bulk transaction using the interface provided by the Payer FSP.</p>
<h5 id="41042-step-12">4.10.4.2 Step 12</h5>
<p>The Payer is notified by the Payer FSP that the bulk is ready for review.</p>
<p>The Payer will get a bulk transaction report and validate that the specified Payees have accounts and can receive funds.</p>
<p>The Payer can also validate any fees that will be charged for executing the bulk transaction. Fees will be calculated per transaction in the bulk transaction.</p>
<p>Before the bulk transaction is executed, the Payer must ensure that there are enough funds in the Payer account for the value of the complete bulk transaction to be completed. Depending on scheme rules the Payer FSP needs to ensure that there are enough funds prefunded to the Payee FSP to be able to complete the transactions to the Payee.</p>
<p>If the Payer is satisfied after reviewing the bulk transaction, then the Payer will initiate the execution of the bulk transaction.</p>
<p>If the Payer does not want to execute the bulk transaction, then the bulk transaction can be canceled. Cancellation will be
handled internally in the Payer FSP. No information regarding cancelation will be sent to the Payee FSP.</p>
<p>How execution and cancelation is handled depends on the implementation in the Payer FSP.</p>
<h5 id="41043-step-21">4.10.4.3 Step 21</h5>
<p>The Payer can review the result of the bulk transaction execution when the Payer FSP has processed all the transactions in the uploaded bulk transaction.</p>
<p>The Payer will be able to get details about the execution for each individual transaction.</p>
<p>Any reprocessing that might be needed to be executed (for example, failed transactions) will be treated as a new bulk transaction in the API.</p>
<h4 id="4105-relevant-error-conditions">4.10.5 Relevant Error Conditions</h4>
<p>Bulk Transactions have two main types of logical errors: Errors connected to the header and errors related to the transactions in the bulk transaction.</p>
<p>An error related to the header will fail the complete bulk transaction. For example, if the Payer of the bulk transaction is blocked, then no transaction shall be executed.</p>
<p>Errors related to an individual transaction within the bulk transaction will get a failed status and be assigned an error code. The amount of the transaction that failed will be rolled back. Other transactions in the bulk transaction will not be affected if one individual transaction fails.</p>
<p>Table 21 contains a description of general error cases to give an overview of the bulk transaction use case and how different error cases are handled. Detailed error codes for the operations are not included, nor are codes for communication errors and format validations errors.</p>

<h3 id="411-refund">4.11 Refund</h3>
<p>This section describes how to refund a completed interoperability transaction.</p>
<p>There are several refund scenarios for merchant payment transaction:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The customer has entered an amount incorrectly and paid more than the invoice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The merchant is not able to deliver the goods as specified by the invoice already paid by the customer, so the merchant wants to refund money to the customer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An online merchant selling tickets (train, air or bus) provides a refund to a customer when the customer cancels the ticket.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The customer has returned the goods to the merchant and the merchant wants to refund the customer. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional business scenarios may require transaction reversals. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The customer has sent money to incorrect recipient.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The customer accidently created the same transaction twice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is recommended to use refund transaction to fulfill the business purpose.</p>
<p>The business process will remain as reversal, but the technical implementation would require Payee FSP CCE to initiate a refund transaction. Payer FSP CCE coordinates with Payee CCE manually. If there is a Switch, then Switch administrator may help to facilitate the conversation between Payer FSP and Payee FSP.</p>
<p>Note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Refund can only be initiated by Payee of the original transaction. Alternatively, CCE of Payee FSP in the original transaction can also initiate refund from Payee account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An original transaction can be refunded multiple times.</p>
</li>
